"""should be considered among the worst""",Business,07/18/24,Singapore,"  Ground Staff and Service Failures on Flight EK 354. My carefully planned return trip from UK, with EMIRATES turned into a nightmare due to issues caused by their Dubai ground staff.  Upon checking in Manchester, I was issued a boarding pass for the MAN-DXB and DXB-SIN legs of my journey, with seats allocated according to my pre booking. However, upon reaching Dubai and during check-in, the counter staff took my boarding pass and issued a new one. Initially, I presumed new boarding pass was due to a soiled document and did not notice the seat change as there is no change in flight. To my disappointment, the new seat I was assigned turned out to be directly in front of the toilet onboard. I also sought assistance from cabin crew and online chat services before take-off, but unfortunately, no one helped me. I had specifically opted for an Economy Flex Plus ticket, solely to secure a seat reservation that would allow for a more comfortable journey. The proximity to the restroom doors, with their associated noise, significantly hindered my ability to rest or enjoy the flight services as intended. Furthermore, crew members accessing the overhead luggage bins above my seat at regular intervals further disrupted any chance of relaxation. Additionally, during the meal service, crew members did not lock the lavatory door, causing passengers to enter and exit while I was eating. This forced me to stop my meal. At the end of the journey, the crew sarcastically asked me about my flight experience, despite being well aware of the difficulties I had faced. Emirates' service in 2024 should be considered among the worst. Until today I have not received any reply on my compliant placed with Emirates and their customer service reminded me that it requires 60 days to send a reply.

The seat is a decent size and has good legroom, again, compared to North American carriers. Catering was good with two full meals and a pizza or sandwich snack in between. Meal portions were good with plenty of variety. I was impressed by the 'engineering' of the economy meal tray with every conceivable space used to offer something.

“the worst airline I've ever flown”,Solo Leisure,05/26/24,Israel," I fly a lot, but Emirates were my worst experiences ever. Most importantly, 2 out of 2 times I flew with them, I was delayed for multiple hours. The first time it was just sitting on the plane with no AC for 2 hours, and the second was 3+ hours, due to some trivial problem with their cabin lights. That 2nd time I had a connecting flight to catch, and while on board they assured me it would be fine, and while I did make it to the gate while they were still boarding, they refused to board me due to having apparently unilaterally decided to rebook me to a flight 11 hours later, assuming I wouldn't make it. Turns out there were earlier flights, but they wouldn't book me to them due to not codesharing with those airlines. Not only was no compensation offered for this day-long delay, but when I finally booked a separate flight on my own, they wouldn't even refund me, and had me request it on my own online. Overall they just showed 0 willingness to help throughout the entire process, despite it being 100% their fault, for a delay caused by them and between flights both of which they operated. They made it as painful as it possibly could be, every step of the way. Oh, and the flights themselves were also bad - old-looking airplanes, terrible food, and relatively limited entertainment.

Arrogant staff refused to ever entertain my request as the app clearly mentioned that I could take up to 115 inches, without mentioning additional cost over 59 inches. 2. Reached DXB.

We paid for extra leg room seats 80J K H so that we could relax and have sleep on the long journeys ahead of us. On 3 of the trips the air stewards were respectful of our space, given we were next to where they served the food and drinks with their trolleys. They were all quiet during the long flights once drinks and food had been served so myself, husband and son could sleep. However, on the flight from Dubai to Bham this could not be a worse experience if Emirates tried. The team were inexperienced (bar one professional) one of them swearing so we could hear F""** word as the curtains were left open, explaining what she required in men. The food and drinks trolley was left next to my husband within an inch of his feet so they stepped over him each time, apologising for waking him up over the next 3 hours. A team of 6 stood in our area having a meeting. After 4 hours into the 8 hr flight, I politely asked if they could move the trolley so we were not disturbed and it was really disrespectful given we had paid extra for the seat. The deputy and mgr came to see us to apologise and talk to their team and moved the trolley. I showed the mgr a picture.

"""discriminating and alienating your passengers""",Couple Leisure,10/12/23,Singapore,"   First I was separated from my wife of 35 years and then despite my plea of a stiff shoulder I was given a window seat in all my 42 years of flying. Emirates seem to treat its tour group passengers as 2nd class passengers without any rights. My wife and I flew to Spain and Portugal from Singapore on a packaged tour with a travel group. On our return flights first from Madrid to Dubai on EK142 on 9 Oct 2023 and from Dubai to Singapore on EK 354 on 10 Oct 2023, my wife and I were placed on window seats on the opposite sides of the aircraft. When I enquired at the check in counter for an aisle seat for the 2 flights as I am a tall bloke with a stiff shoulder (which has been affecting me for the past 5 years), the staff gave me an aisle seat further back and my wife in a window seat 6 rows ahead. She said she tried but could not see the connecting flight seating plan from Dubai to Singapore and advised me to approach the boarding gate in Dubai for help. When we reached Dubai, the tour manager, my wife and I, another another couple who had been in opposite ends of the aircraft made a beeline for the connecting help desk close to B18 boarding gate. The guard refused to let us into the queue even though there was no one queuing and the 2 counter staff were helping a couple of the passengers at the counter. He told us to use the self-help kiosk computer even though we said we needed help with changing the seats. The computer did not do the latter and directed back to the counter. The guard was still reluctant and finally allowed my wife and I in the queue. However, our tour manager and the couple were kept outside the line even though they had legitimate business to speak to someone at the counter. There was a couple talking to a group of the staff outside the counter near the queue and the man was gesticulating wildly in a heated discussion with the staff. Eventually one of the staff involved in the 'conversation' told the guard to admit all of us and 'royally allowed' us to talk to him behind the counter. He told us in no uncertain terms that we were given our seats as 'non-paying' passengers and it was tough luck that we had to be separated. Our tour manager protested that the tour passenger list with familial/partnering connections was given to the airline beforehand but he said we were given a block of seats from rows 81 to 83 and he could not help in any way. My question to the airline is this: if the passenger list has been provided with the different familial/partnering groupings could it not be more accommodating and doing a slipshod job of seating willy nilly without regard for the families and couples travelling together. What happens if there are families with young children? Furthermore if the airline has given a block of seats (say rows 61 to 63 or 81 to 83 and not all window seats or not all middle seats) in advance why can't it have the good sense to pass them on the tour manager beforehand so the tour manager can help to allocate the seats according to the passengers' preference and needs?

"""ignored and overlooked""",Solo Leisure,09/22/23,United Kingdom," I had a poor experience on this flight. I have been using Emirates' services for over 20 years, being a Blue member and, then, a Silver member, up until the time of covid. I have had no reason to complain, previously about Emirates’ service. Sitting in seat 30F, I had ordered vegetarian food, and received a snack soon after take-off, along with a sealed cup of water. Subsequently, meals for other passengers were brought round and people were offered drinks, but I was offered nothing, and the steward moved on too quickly for me to request a drink. At the next opportunity, when a steward passed by, I requested a drink, but was advised to wait until lunch was served (a very poor response, I felt). I reiterated: I would like a drink as soon as possible (as I was thirsty). The person in seat 30G was asleep and I could not exit the seat with causing a disturbance. A drink was subsequently provided (but over 15 minutes later). However, the table in 30F is/was not secure and the drink slid off, spilled over me and the person in 30G next to me. The people sitting either side of me were more helpful than the steward in trying to clear up the mess. Later on, lunch did arrive, but it was 2 hours after I had first requested a drink (so, my request for a drink had been vindicated). When food trays were later collected, mine was overlooked, the steward passed me by, and my food tray was left for over half an hour. When a steward passed by, I asked that the tray be removed and could not understand why I was being treated in what seemed a negligent manner. At this point, I was beginning to become very fed up. A supervisor later came round and asked if I was alright. I was fine (albeit tired), but frustrated at having been ignored and overlooked. The supervisor was firm, but unapologetic, and asked me if I needed anything. I did not need anything, and she left me without further comment, her enquiry appearing pointless to me, as it solved nothing.

We asked and found out that it had been replaced by another flight, operated by a different airline, at a different time. We checked in for this new flight and found out that no transit was possible in Johannesburg. Therefore we had to go through immigration, retrieve our luggage, queue again for the check in, pass security and passport control to get on our next flight to Dubai.

Added to that however, was the 50 minutes to queue in the Online Check-in, having arrived at the airport more than the recommended 3 hours before flight departure. This is presumably as a result of only 2 check-in counters open for Online check-in. 2 were available for those who had not checked in, and these seemed to move more quickly.

"""refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage""",Family Leisure,07/16/23,United States,"  The issues I encountered include a significant problem with their cancellation policy, lack of responsiveness from their customer service team, concerning safety practices, refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage, an extensive delay during the return flight, and a stark contrast in service quality between Economy and Business class. Regarding the cancellation policy, I received misleading information from three representatives, who assured me that I would receive a full refund if I canceled within 24 hours. However, they failed to mention the crucial condition that this only applied when the flight was at least 7 days after the initial booking. As a result, I tried to cancel within the 24-hour window but could only reschedule. This cost me a $500 loss vs. the option of cancelling and booking a new flight for the following day. Despite Emirates acknowledging in writing their mistake, they repeatedly refused to provide a price match or refund, and eventually even stopped replying to my follow up messages on the open complain. The lack of responsiveness from Emirates compounded my frustration. Numerous follow-up messages went unanswered, showing a lack of interest in resolving the issues I faced.  During the flight, I was alarmed by a safety practice where all blankets were collected and piled in front of the emergency exits.  Emirates also declined to reimburse me for one of two damaged pieces of luggage, despite the damage occurring during their handling.  Furthermore, the return flight experienced a significant delay for a missing document, resulting in passengers being seated on the plane for over two hours, including boarding time. Despite the delay being just a few minutes short of two hours, the lack of updates, assistance, and provisions such as free Wi-Fi or refreshments left passengers feeling inconvenienced and neglected.

"""worst experience of my lifetime""",Couple Leisure,05/31/23,United States,"  I had the worst experience of my lifetime flying with Emirates. It all started from Thiruvananthapuram where our travel began, food was just pathetic and the service is just awful. Let alone the seats are not even comfortable with hardly any legroom. Sitting on the seat for less than an hour and you feel your bones crushing on the frame of the seat. The flight attendants seem like overly busy even if they were to walk past you and you ask them for a glass of water. The next leg was the long haul. Both my wife and I were just exhausted with the service and the flight attendants wouldn't even get a band aid after I cut myself from hitting my feet on the fasteners of the seat.  We waited for almost an hr after boarding from Dubai to take off and I ended up cutting myself while being seated and I showed my feet to the flight attendant, and she didn't even care to get back to me until my wife had to address it 48 minutes later.  The seats are as poor as the first leg. How do you expect customers to sit in these seats for such long-haul flights. No legroom and the people in front when they recline the seat your stuck with the tray on your diaphragm. I seriously dreaded the flight and the attendants as well. There was a lot of overhead Cabin baggage space where she could open and look but instead just chose to stand where she was and asked me if she could move my bag. Then when another passenger had to get his bag up, she asks my wife if the bag was hers and it was the bag of the passenger behind us. She was like it's my bag and leave it there and then the flight attendant got back to us and asked my wife to move her bag and I said no. Why don't you move the other bag instead. She didn't even have the courtesy to look for other bins if it wasn't full. But just stood in her vicinity to put the bag in and get the job done. I don't understand why do these kind of staff even work. Going to TRV via Dubai the men flight attendants were just so rude that they act like they are doing you a favor by getting you a glass of water. They asked if there's anything else like it was a big, huge task for them to get a glass of water.

"""handed a sleeping bag with no explanation""",Family Leisure,01/13/23,Japan,"  We were scheduled to depart at 10.30pm I was travelling with my 10 year old son. We moved away from the gate and was told there was a technical issue so we had to return. Over an hour later we were told it was resolved and we left the gate again. As we were taxiing the pilot came on and said that Narita Airport had decided to conduct runway maintenance so we had to return to the gate again. This was the first problem - this was a lie. Narita Airport does not allow any aircraft to take off after midnight, this is why we could not take off and there is no way that Emirates did not know this. We returned to the gate and waited for an hour with no information. Then they said they would serve dinner - this is at 1am! I had no desire to eat dinner at 1am. With no further information we were told we had to deplane at 3am - so nearly five hours on the tarmac - and the ground staff would deal with us when we got off the plane. When we got off the plane, I was handed a sleeping bag with no explanation. When I asked they said we had to sleep at the gate. Eventually we were told that the flight might depart at 3pm the next day - 17 hours after the scheduled departure. No accommodation was provided or even offered. They announced breakfast at 9.30 am by which time was son was starving hungry anyway, so I had already paid for breakfast myself. Breakfast was a small piece of pizza bread and some water. There was no lunch. They did rebook my connecting flight from Dubai to Manchester, however we had already missed Christmas Eve by this point which was the whole reason we were leaving on December 23rd. Now, I understand that technical issues occur. I can even understand that we might be delayed by 17 hours. However, being forced to wait on the plane for 5 hours when they knew we were never going to depart, being lied to about the reason, not being given accommodation or proper food - these are all things I cannot accept and so wrote a complaint. My request for compensation has now been denied three times. They have said that Article 9 of their Conditions of Carriage says that they do not guarantee departure dates or times. If that is the case - how can any customer trust them to depart at a time and date that they paid for? Good food, good seats, good entertainment system, mediocre cabin crew.

I don’t know if it’s because they don’t pay the air hostesses enough or maybe they just became over confident. I took a flight from Bali (Indonesia) to London (via Dubai). Firstly , the stewardess’s are more focused on just giving champagne than helping the customers find their seat and helping with luggage. They don’t want to do any hard work. Can’t even be bothered to smile or pretend to be kind. The business part looked more like premium economy. (You definitely don’t get what you paid for on Emirates) 10 hrs flight to Dubai and nightmare. Food has got worse and worse over the years. I don’t know if they changed the catering?

"""the crew were nowhere to be seen""",Couple Leisure,12/29/22,United States,"  My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on November 24th 2022 from Seattle to Dubai, seated in row 19, and sadly it was the experience I was expecting.  This was a 14+ hour flight, and one would think the crew would be friendly and check on the passengers more, however the only time we saw them was during boarding, food service and disembarking and without smiles. After and before the food service the crew were nowhere to be seen. On other flights with other airlines the air hostesses will come by a couple of time with water/ tea/coffee or just even walk by to make sure if anything was needed. I understand people may want to sleep but you can also do it without waking up the passengers. Thirdly, the food was not appetizing, and not only that but if Emirates is releasing the menu on the app with a couple options (veg and non-veg) on the plane I was told I cant have the veg because I didn’t order it, Then why was it an option and it didn’t have anything on the side that said Pre-order. Ended up taking the meal with he chicken which was dry and hard like a baseball. I didn’t eat it. We were served a pizza snack and it wasn’t warmed up well. I am not one who leaves reviews but I understand that Emirates is a well renowned brand and company and my review will not matter to them but at the end of the day it was my hard earned money that I used to pay for my Flight.

I could walk around and pick any seat I want in the lounge without having to sit next to strangers. Tables in the dining area were quickly cleared and cleaned after guests left, so they were always ready for the next guests. One unique thing about Emirates was that I could board directly from the lounge, which made things much easier. On board, the A380 was nice. Every seat had a minibar, which was nice. Emirates does not offer full turndown service the way Qatar Airways does, but a mattress pad was provided (like on Japan Airlines) to make a more comfortable bed. The gender specific amenity kit, by Bvlagri, was very nice and useful. Food was good in general, and wine selection was ahead of other airlines, but service was slow and a bit inconsistent.

Boarding is messy. Boarding music is terrible and, if delayed, played on repeat for hours. The seat is quite nice. The crew works very hard, but the service is just chaotic and messy with their trays, stuff stacked on top of each other. Meal service starts 2 hours after take off. On the way back used the business lounge in Dubai. It is far from the quality of lounges other airlines have, including most European airlines. Again delayed. Gipsy King music again for the 2 hours on ground during boarding. Poorly informed by the captain and mixed/contradicting info from the cabin crew.

"""not a very good experience""",Solo Leisure,12/13/22,Bahrain," This was not a very good experience. Starting with the Airport, I was forced to check one of my carry-ons due to “no space” on the plane although it was not a full flight and I was made to pay a huge amount of money just for that and what’s worse is that the bag had a lot fragile souvenirs and I risked breaking all of them. Thank goodness it was loaded in Japan and no harm was done and the bag dodged a bullet. I don’t remember Emirates being that needlessly strict. I’m not sure if the airline changed the aircraft because the extra legroom seat that I paid for was different than the one I got as the exit door was in the way so I had to lean a little on the person next to me to get the full legroom feel. It was a long flight but it went smooth and the food was extremely delicious. The flight attendant that was assigned to our row, although efficient, made me feel like an inconvenience as she had very low energy and didn’t seem very enthusiastic to the point that while was pouring me apple juice, the carton ran out of juice while the cup was half full and that’s how she served it without bothering to open another carton. For the whole flight I was waiting for her to pass by us so I can ask the other, much nicer attendant for water and/or assistance whenever I needed something.

"""worse than my already very low expectations""",Solo Leisure,12/02/22,United Kingdom,"  I have been flying Emirates for 15 years and was a gold member for much of that time. From 2007 - 2012 their customer service was almost unmatched but things have been getting worse over the past 10 years or so and now I would say it is the worst of any airline in the world. I have flown Emirates 3 times this year out of necessity and each time it has been a complete disaster. Emirates has now switched from operating like a typical full service carrier to something more akin to a low-cost airline. Not only do they have 4 fare classes (economy, premium, business & first) but each of those classes is split into 4 types (special, saver, flex & flex-plus). The saver fares usually look too good to be true because they are! If you find a low price on a special or saver fare when booking in advance you may think you got a good deal but try to make any changes to the flight and you will soon find that the airline tries to gauge you for extortionate 'fare differences'. Even if you try to change your flight to one that costs exactly the same as the flight you are on and there are empty seats in your fare class, they will tell you that your 'fare type' is no longer available and extort you for hundreds if not thousands of dollars to make the change. Even if the flight you're on is full and the flight you want to switch to is half empty (something you think the airline would be glad of) they still try to gauge you. If you're lucky enough to get through to customer service, they will not offer you any assistance whatsoever - their job is just to extract as much extra cash from you as they can. I have come to expect this and so avoid Emirates where I can. My latest experience with Emirates customer service was far worse than my already very low expectations. I tried to use the Emirates app to make a change to the flight time. I had a Saver fair so there was a change fee of £100. This was clearly stated in the terms and conditions of the ticket so I was happy to pay. However, when I got to the screen to put in my credit card details, the app crashed. I tried again and the same thing happened. Rather than keep trying to work with a defective app, I called the airline to make the change over the phone. A recorded message said that the airline was extremely busy and that if I was not flying in the next 48 hours, I should hang up and call back later. I complied with this request and hung up the call. As soon as I got back to my hotel room, I got on the laptop to make the change. despite only being a couple of hours later, there was suddenly a 'fare difference' to pay. Since it was the Emirates app that had failed when I tried to make the change and since their call center was too busy to take my call at that time, I was sure that Emirates would do the right thing and match the price from when I had first attempted the change. I thought wrong! I spoke to a hopeless fist line call center worker who could not help so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor said that he did not have any authority to make changes to flights, despite the fact that he told me that he was the most senior person in the airline I could speak to. Eventually, I was put through to another man a second level supervisor (or ""officer"")",A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to London via Dubai,12/02/22,no,Trip Verified,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,A380-800

You pay a lot to fly business class, so the expectation that something as simple as the food to be hot should be expected. Both flights the food was Luke warm. Can't stand cold food. It maybe the size of the A380 business class, but the whole set up seemed cold. Took off, and it was like a conveyor belt. Seat cushion on for sleep. Food orders taken. Place mat down. Crew were like robots, zero warmth. Qantas do the same, but just felt totally different. More customer interaction and dare I say warmth. 777 flight was a little better but the food was still cold. Sorry unacceptable in business class or even economy for that matter. Not looking forward to our flight from Europe back to Singapore in 6 weeks. When you save to fly business class, when the airline gets it wrong you feel ripped off. Yes they got us there in one piece with our luggage so I suppose I should be happy with that.

I again understand that lounge may not be available but she could have shown some empathy and could have tried from her end to facilitate us by saying let me check if possible.

I believe Emirates staff should communicate with the passenger clearly about the important information specially when someone like me who is going on Dubai Airport first time.

This last time check-in took a bit too much than I would expect for Business, but security fast-track works well and is convenient. In Lisbon Emirates uses the TAP lounge which is a bummer as other than being very crowded at all times, it is located before passport control (Schengen area) which forces people to leave much earlier than boarding start. If flying Business in the Boeing 777-300 do choose the front mini-cabin (first 2 rows before the door) as all the 300+ Economy passengers board through the door before the aft cabin leading to an annoying 1h boarding process with people passing by. Food and crew are usually great and very helpful and friendly. At Dubai very easy process to go through priority passport control and to reach the complimentary limo service, all very efficient. I have found some drivers to be quite rude and/or driving dangerously - Emirates should improve their standards for this personnel.

I bought my seat at the time of booking and the system wouldn’t let me to do the same for my daughters. At the time of online check in, I found out that my daughters were seated 7 rows ahead of me on their own which shocked me. Furthermore, I raised my concerns to the officer at the check-in desk. Her seat allocation was more terrible than the system. She allocated me in the middle seat, 2 year at the aisle and 7 year aisle right across making her to sit with a stranger. I was frightened to hear that bad news and had to escalate the issue to the supervisor. Finally, after 20-25 minutes of waiting, supervisor made me (compulsion) to sit with my daughters 7 seats ahead of my paid chosen seat. At least, it was a big relief for me before boarding. Money paid for my chosen seat was gone into Emirates account and no refund was made until now. More paper work following to claim it and a waste of time, so let Emirates enjoy that undeserved money. Service offered by the airline was below standard when compared to the rest of Middle Eastern Carriers and other standard carriers. Families travelling with kids were of least to no concern by the crew. However, I have to admit that Emirates managed to arrive the destination on time. On the return leg, my luggage is not delivered yet or lost on the way. Another issue to deal with Emirates now. Service had gone from standard to pathetic. I need to think million one times to make another booking with Emirates. Families travelling with kids are not recommended to choose this airline.

I doubt they are any better than a 2-star service. Their airport staffs are either rude or cold. Their in-flight food service is mediocre. Although, the food is above average. They offer minimal service when it comes to offering water or drinks during the flight. I tried upgrading using family account points, a feature with Emirates. It is more or less a scam scheme designed to pool all your points in your family account. The idea is you can upgrade your journey or family members' journey using the family account. However, you cannot access these points when you want to upgrade. So you are left with no points in your account and storing all your points in your family account, and you can't use them. Emirates airport staffs and cabin crews are so poorly trained. Both Airline check-in staff, Cabin Crew and support staff have no clue how the family account works. I heard 4-different versions of the policies. They send me round in circles on 2 different trips, and the issue still remains unresolved after a week. As a gold member, I get a pleasant smile and a warm welcome, but that is just faking a few words that have no value whatsoever. Anytime I requested any help, I more or less got nothing for being Gold. The only thing that remains for being Gold is Fast Check-in in the Dubai airport and a few other airports outside the UAE, Lounge access, and sometimes faster delivery of your check-in baggage.

Regrettably, not all lounge operators have the selection of food and beverages or ambience that we offer in our Emirates Lounges. However, your feedback is noted and has been shared with the relevant team for their information. Through emirates.com we do advise customers that for technical reasons we are unable to provide Wi-Fi, mobile phone, mobile data and live television services on every flight, or guarantee a continuous service. Emirates' liability is therefore limited. However, I acknowledge that this added to your disappointment. With regard to your request for the mixed grill, we always aim to match the quantity of choices with the predicted passenger preferences. While we do our utmost to meet all passenger requests, sometimes there may be shortages of a particular meal choice due to previous passenger selection. Shortages of a particular meal are continuously monitored in order to adjust ratios accordingly for future flights. It is my understanding that got your first choice of starter (potato soup), your preferred dessert, the chocolate caramel tarte, and opted for the beef meal instead. On another note, Business Class kit bags are offered on flights over 3 hours 30 minutes that depart between the hours of 22:00 to 05:00 and on all flights over 9 hours regardless of the departure time. However, certain toiletry items are available in the lavatories for the comfort of our passengers and may also be requested from our cabin crew.

Things that impressed me included the superb food and wine on all sectors (incl a nice printed menu and wine list), the wonderful Emirates First Class Lounges in Dubai (especially their prime lounge), the speedy and efficient boarding and the good cabin crews. Not so good was trying to get to a toilet in the middle of the night and having to make my way past lots of drunken passengers filling the bar area at the back of the A380 - which is also the area where the toilets are.

"""CDG - DXB sector was a complete disgrace""",Business,05/22/22,France,"  Only the second time I choose to fly Emirates, so I will not make a fast decision as to use this airline again or not. But I have to say that in all the years I have been flying business, the CDG - DXB sector was a complete disgrace. From the chaotic boarding in Paris when all first and business class passengers were held at the gate for 25 minutes (apparently for no reasons except that some sort of VIP showed up at some point and cut the line), without so much as an announcement from the person in charge. Once everyone was on board, the first announcement from the captain was about an hour delay in getting a takeoff slot. As we pushed back, their APU went out, no lights and aircon and back to the gate. Then some very vague information from the flight deck on some repairs being done, and another slot waiting time. Anyway the whole deal lasted 3 hours. Ok, that is a technical problem, it happens and that is the way it is. What bothered me during the whole time was the complete disdain of the cabin crew for the passengers. As a matter of facts, most of them seemed to enjoy the delay and were having some very long and loud conversations with some apparent friends in the aisles. The flight finally took off. And this is when the cabin crew showed its complete inability to handle the most basic service. Absolutely no care for the passengers, and except for some meal served in a hurry (during which I actually had to beg for a glass of wine previously ordered ) we only got to see them once in a while during the whole 7,5 hours. I want to think that this was a bad timing, or else. On the other end, the second leg of the flight from DXB to Moscow was excellent, and I actually found out how much was missing on the first leg then: Friendly and helpful cabin crew, good service. After all this is what we ask for in a flight! My rating will be below at 5/10.

The ticketing lady had a very bad attitude told me to show her my Covid test result which I did, then asking for Vaccination card that I responded that I am USA citizen and there is no need to have this card, which she started talking loud and being so rude, finally I found my card and passed it to her. After that I was glad that the issue was resolved and now she would process my luggage. I was wrong. She laid back at her chair and doing nothing. Finally I said to her this checking takes long time, please process my luggage. At the end I went to her team leader and explained her behavior. I am sure that the leader would not do anything to correct his group attitudes, because all of them are the same and they do not know any better, but I am sure that Emirates will lose more customers as times pass.

I asked them for an accommodation through Dubai connect program, they refused to book anything or even provide a meal voucher (like Qatar Airways) reasoning that I am the one choosing to not to fly to Paris on immediate available connection, therefore, no accommodation or food for you.

It was my first Emirates experience in 3 years, and as far as I was concerned nothing had changed, apart from the boarding procedure in Dubai which was nothing short of shambolic - but that is the airport, not the airline. As a direct result of the ineptitude of the gate staff we pushed back 1 hour 20 mins late. No matter. The service was friendly and efficient - nothing was too much trouble - and the food and drink really good. One doesn’t often have memorable meals on board any aircraft (preparation of same must be trying in the extreme), but the lunch served was top notch.

Passengers walked through the vomit and no clean-up was done. Boarding was unorganized with no sense of order. The aircraft pushed back approximately two hours after departure time. An announcement was made by a pilot stating the delay was due to 'baggage handling technical problems.' The digital menu was not working.

I requested a drink in the galley from a cabin crew and he pointed to cups and a bottle of water and said 'get it yourself.' Cabin temperature was freezing cold. The seat was comfortable.

Four infants on my flight were training talk show hosts as their lungs and screams lasted the entire 15 hour flight to SEA. The plane was full and staff gave little concern for passengers. On arrival in SEA the airline took forever (1.5 hours) to get luggage to customer even though I had a first class luggage tag on my one bag. Onward booking by airline had incorrect boarding info for ongoing flight and barely made the connection. Cannot imagine what others waited and how many missed connections. Yes, SEA is an airport to avoid for customs and general connection flights.

The flight was fully booked which was quite bothersome at a time when everyone around the world are practising social distancing, the faucets in both the lavatories in his proximity were overflowing and I was told that the crew had been wearing the same masks throughout the 13-14 hour flight. This is an epitome of how Emirates treats its non-premium class as the ""cattle-class"" and that basic hygiene and comfort don't really matter for those who decide to fly at a lower rate. Really ashamed at Emirates for the inequality that they show. During these unprecedented times, they must take into account the passenger's health and safety rather than looking at profits.

The touch screen did not work. On the way back 1 seat and 1 sound system did not work out of three. They charge heavily for wifi and they charge significantly for a seat in front. At a rate where other airlines offer premium economy, Emirates just let you sit a couple of seats in front. European and US carriers by now have closed the gap and surpassed Emirates offering better wifi, premium economy and more innovative entertainment systems (Delta lets you watch from your own iPad). KLM flies this route with brand new 787's. But where an airline should make the real difference, Emirates fails even harder. Service. They get stuck in organizational bureaucracy.

Sure enough 20 minutes later a beef meal arrived and was promptly dumped on the meal tray and was stone cold. The crew through the 15 hours were noticeably aggressive to all and sundry.

"""Emirates is way overpriced for what you actually get""",Business,02/16/20,Singapore,"  I've flown business class (as well as premium economy) many times on long-haul flights between Asia and the US, on a pretty wide variety of airlines. For my current trip, there appeared to be a reasonably good business class fare (but not the best fare among all airline selections) to NYC via Dubai on Emirates, apparently because of a long (7+ hour) layover in Dubai. Even though it wasn't the best business class fare available among all airlines, and the layover was longer than I'd prefer, I chose Emirates based on their reputation. However, Emirates doesn't inform you when purchasing the ticket, and you don't find out until you arrive at the airport in Dubai, that this business class fare does not include any lounge access. So, you basically get a slight discount on a business class fare, but no business class lounge access during a 7+ hour layover. Also, on the Emirates 777-300ER, the business class seat does not actually lay flat (its angled quite a bit), and the leg / foot section of the seat when extended is rather flimsy. Unless you have a child-size body, it's quite difficult to get comfortable for any actual sleep on a long haul ""business class"" flight with the type of seat that Emirates installed on the 777-300ER. Based on my actual flight and in-airport experiences, I'd rank business class on other airlines much higher than Emirates business class. For long haul travel between Asia and the US, I'd even rank Philippine Airlines business class in a higher category than Emirates, particular because Philippine Airlines business class fares are typically several to many hundreds of USD cheaper than Emirates best business class fares, and you aren't subjected to any undisclosed trickery relating to business class lounge access. I'll avoid Emirates in the future, for sure - Emirates is way overpriced for what you actually get. Come to think of it, for a route between Asia and NYC through the Mideast, I'd have to say premium economy on Qatar Airlines is a much better value for the money, with a reasonably good comfort level as well as excellent service, as compared to Emirates business class.",Boeing 777-300ER,Business,Business Class,Ho Chi Minh City to Newark via Dubai,02/16/20,no,Not Verified,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,Boeing 777-300ER

"""I will never fly with them again""",Family Leisure,02/08/20,Australia,"  Brisbane to Zurich via Dubai. After hearing nothing but great things about Emirates I have been left so disappointed. Our first leg from Brisbane to Dubai started with them not giving my 7 year old daughter her meal. Not only did they forget the first meal of the 14hr flight but I had to ask them again for the second meal. Approximately 4 hours out from Dubai the oxygen masks dropped from the panels above. After 15 long minutes we were advised that they thought it is a technical issue. Passengers were then asked to fold up the oxygen masks as best we could and they were left hanging in front of us. Following this there was no in-flight entertainment or service for the remainder of the flight. No compensation was offered and staff seemed more concerned about passengers who were recording the incident. After our horrendous flight and poor service from Brisbane, I asked at Heathrow about an upgrade and was told flights to Brisbane were fully booked. This was not true as the Dubai to Brisbane leg was half empty and many people had three seats to themselves. The check in procedure at Heathrow we had to use the self service machines and this was not made clear until we had already queued for 25 minutes. There were no toilets in the lounges at Heathrow and Dubai which meant that once you had shown your passport and ticket and gone into the lounge you had to go back outside to the toilets and then queue again. Our flight from London departed at 9pm. My daughter didn’t end up getting her meal until 11.50pm. It took them 2.5hrs to commence the meal service. The flight from Dubai to Brisbane was no better. My 7 year old needed to go to the toilet as soon as we got on the plane and the toilet hadn’t been cleaned. My 7 year old fell asleep on take off so I asked if her meal could be kept for later when she woke up. I was told this was not a problem however when I asked for it 7 hours later I was told we she couldn’t have as they couldn’t reheat it. I then had to ask if I could at least get the other food that didn’t require being reheated. The customer service on three of the four flights was absolutely appalling. The flight attendants were not pleasant and friendly.  On one flight I pressed the buzzer for some water due to my daughter being asleep on me and no-one attended at all – the plane landed 1.5 hours after I pressed the buzzer and we disembarked. I could not get over the amount of time the seat belt signs came on when there was barely any turbulence. On top of this, the excessive amount of time they kept the seatbelt sign on when there was no turbulence was ridiculous. At one point it had been on for over one hour and my daughter needed the toilet. We got up to go to the toilet and I was told I would be going at our own risk.  It felt to me that they kept the seat belt sign on for an extended period so the crew got out of doing work. I have travelled extensively for the past 20 years and Emirates is the worst airline I have ever flown with. Do not waste your money.

I pre ordered hindu non veg meal. During food service, I informed the cabin crews about my change of seat, but one crew served me a packet saying Hindu non-veg meal which was not hindu meal. My all other family members got different foods in their hindu meal.  The most confusing in the  journey was Emirates hotel policy. I booked a ticket from Emirates website with fare basis economy saver and 13 hrs stop over in Dubai having no shorter connection. My family members purchased same economy save ticket with almost same fare but from agents and they got Dubai Connect voucher.

The only thing for me on the flight that was a stand out was the catering that was very good, as was the wine selection - which strangely enough was not top shelf wines but very good middle of the road wine. What was bizarre for me was the lack of training in the food and wine that the crew had. Did not know the wines and served the caviar with a metal spoon. I asked for a bone spoon and they said that they did not have any - and when I pointed out that metal reacts with the caviar and that is why it is not normally used, they looked at me if I was from the moon. Also bad practice was making First passengers pay for wifi. The flight was a code share with Qantas and the crew kept telling me wifi was free if I joined their FF programme.

"""need to re-train cabin crew""",Business,10/16/19,Australia,"  Melbourne to Amsterdam via Dubai. Disappointed with the experience in general. I have flown with Emirates since the last 15 years & was easy to see how the service has gone downhill. The cabin crew (with an exception of a few) didn't seem interested in their job, no sign of any courtesy what so ever. I felt as if they are doing us a favour letting us fly on their airline, sorry but we paid for our seats, it wasn't a free ride.  On a specific incident, during food service from Dubai to Amsterdam, noticed that the cabin crew ran out of lunch options from the two sets ahead of me, which is understandable. However the cabin crew still kept asking the following passengers including myself what would we like to have only to bluntly respond back that they have run out of options. Just couldn’t understand why was she asking what we passengers would like to have when she did not have any option in the first place? This was repeated over and over again finally asking the two passengers next to me. When I questioned her about this, she had no answer, soon after I could clearly see her behaviour towards me was immediately inhospitable, she even walked passed me without asking if I needed to have a tea or coffee. I didn’t care about the tea or coffee, but guess what it did leave me with a bad taste for the airline, besides I do get to have the last say by inputting a poor score on the infotainment screen at the end of the flight, which I did. Cabin crew of airlines thank or greet their passengers while disembarking, however noticed that some of the cabin crew in Emirates didn’t seem to bother. On a positive note, the ground staff are great & at least courteous, something that is missing once you get on flight.

When we just arrived at the airport with my colleague we learned already that the flight would be delayed and ETA planned at 00:00. Just 15 min before the planned new departure, still no news. I had to go and try to get some info to be informed by chance that the flight has to land in Lucknow - 40 min away from Dehli for weather conditions. But a few more minutes to refuel and the flight would bridge at Dehli. Planned new departure: 1:40am. We then learned around 1:20 am that the flight would be delayed until 7:30 PM.with no further explanations. The whole crowd started to get mad, complaining vocally to the staff who had no explanation to give. I learned by chance again afterwards that the flying staff was on too many extra hours and had to rest before re-flying. Emirates did not anticipate this obvious issue that made the flight to Dubai impossible for a long time. After more than 1 hour of complaining and shouting, and no answers from the staff, a passenger took the lead and had to inform everyone that anyway our only solution would be to collect back our luggage and try to find an alternative flight if any. I decided to call Emirates who booked me on the 11 am flight as the 4:14 am flights with all the mess around would not be catchable for any of us despite the fact that 26 seats were still available due to the boarding pass issue. It took us another hour to go through the passport control back in a chaotic situation and finally get our luggage back. Emirates claimed that they would offer us a hotel and breakfast. But getting out of the airport we discovered that the 360 passengers we waiting on a parking lot for buses to come to drive us 40 min away from the airport. It would take 2 hours to get our room and it was already 4:30 am. We decided to avoid the mess and stay at the airport with no sleep and not even a single bottle of water given by Emirates. At 7 am when we checked in again and complained about our dreadful experience, the staff claimed that it was well managed, Emirates offering us a hotel room and a breakfast.

I just love the A380 aircraft and Emirates business class layout with the bar at the back. The decor is a bit plastic for my taste, but I take the airline for its unbeatable fares, its fantastic lounges with a quite amazing food and beverage selection, its on board service, the supreme comfort of the seating, the massive IFE selection and large screens. With first class dropped from this flight, the front of the upper deck now seats around 100 economy passengers. Yet the FA's usually make sure that these passengers remain seated whilst business class passengers can exit first. Given the economies that all airlines are now making, fast track cards are no longer handed out (not a problem for me as I have automatic fast entry at both airports), the main selection of the meal course is reduced to two offerings and the snacks in the bar are not as tasty as they used to be. But that is all rather irrelevant given all the pluses. On the outward sector I was too busy working to dine or use the IFE. I made do with a glass of the superb Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc and a sandwich from the bar. Having eaten well in the lounge, I also declined the meal on the return flight but did enjoy this time a fine Pinot Noir and another chunky chicken sandwich.

However, Emirates has decided to put the past behind and embark on a poorly schemed, appalling venture of cost cutting at the cost of passenger comfort whilst still charging passengers exorbitantly. The first sector was from Colombo to Dubai. It was quite acceptable that Emirates never focused on its Asian sectors for they have extreme confidence that it's competitive pricing and brand name would get them customers inevitably. Therefore, I boarded this old 777-300, the inflight entertainment was certainly not much of a great deal on the first sector with quite limited options and by trying to handle it's terribly dysfunctional remote and put it back into its position, the wire had cut my finger. It gave me the worst airplane food ever. The crew on this sector thought were the only appealing segments of what I would call the emisery. They were attentive and kind and maintained a smile but however did not go the extra mile like the qatar airways cabin crew who were an extreme delight. Furthermore, another factor that put me off completely was how narrow and uncomfortable seats were. It was a completely disastrous 4 hours and 10 minutes.

"""a 22-hour nightmare for us""",Family Leisure,08/07/19,United States,"  A few weeks ago, I flew between Los Angeles to Mumbai via Dubai with family and it was a 22-hour nightmare for us. This was our first time with Emirates. We have traveled extensively with other airlines like Etihad, BA, and Lufthansa. But this time, unfortunately, we decided to buy a nightmare by paying way more than other good airlines. It all started with check-in baggage. The check-in counter crew demanded our passports without greeting or smile. In the past, some stuff was stolen from my bags so I asked them to put the zip ties on the locks. After I insisted she threw some plastic zip ties at me and asked to put them on the locks with a red face. They flew one of the filthiest A380 on the planet. The plane looked pretty old with dirty bathrooms and broken seats. I requested the Hindu meal for my family (three of us) and the steward only got two of the meals. I asked him politely about my meals and his response was ""I only got two hands"". Later he came back and said he accidentally gave it to someone else and I have to eat whatever they have left. I later talked to the head of the crew about the incident and she apologized and promised me that she will take care of the next meal. Nothing happened except now ""The steward"" giving us angry looks every time he passes by.

A fellow passenger who asked for the second option on the regular menu was told that he will have to wait 15 minutes for that to be served.

The segment between Edinburgh and Singapore was on a much older B777 wide-body plane. The seats do not lie 180 flat but at an angle. That is my main issue with the flight. The seat was so uncomfortable that I didn't get any sleep. The food was ok. The flight attendant was ok but lacking warmth. For instance, when I boarded the flight I handed over my jacket asking politely ""would you mind hanging this up for me"" to one of the flight attendants but was replied rather coldly that she would come back to me later. I understand that boarding is one of the busiest times for them but she was just not that friendly when she responded as if I was making an outrageous demand. However, the service in the second segment was better. Their A380-800 has an older fit-out and the stainless steel handrails make it really outdated but at least the seat lay flat 180 degrees and I managed to have a couple of hours sleep. The transit at Dubai airport was not a nice experience, the lounge is outdated and it was so crowded. It felt like being a cattle market.

"""Emirates should really rethink boarding times""",Family Leisure,07/08/19,Kuwait,"  Kuwait to Amman via Dubai on 3rd July 2019. If you ever depart from Kuwait and are flying Emirates, I’d strongly suggest using online check-in. At KWI, Emirates has a separate counter for online check-in passengers thus enabling passengers to skip the queue and proceed directly to the counter without having to wait. Be aware that during online check-in, you will not receive e-boarding passes if departing from Kuwait. I contacted Emirates and was told this is not an issue. At the counter, I received the boarding passes for both flights EK 856 (KWI-DXB) and my connecting flight EK 903 (DXB-AMM). The check-in experience was smooth, and within 10 minutes, I was through to immigration and security. Online check-in if departing from Kuwait is a lifesaver! First leg EK 856 from Kuwait to Dubai on the B777-300 ER. Boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. It was chaotic as expected for a fully-booked flight. Unfortunately, the aircraft was really old (registration A6-EBE). The screen was very small and ICE version was also very old. 3-4-3 configuration is not a favorite, and the seats felt narrow. Only 1 meal choice and no menus were given. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Kuwait due to late completion of boarding. Luckily, arrival in Dubai was only 5 minutes late despite the 30 minute delay departing Kuwait. If possible, book a seat on the left or right side of the aircraft (rows A, B, C or H, J, K). These seats will feel less cramped than seats in the middle (rows D, E, F, G). I was seated in seat 33A. Overall, a good flight although I’d avoid the EK B777 economy product all-together (unfortunately EK doesn’t fly the A380 to Kuwait so that’s not possible). Second leg EK 903 from Dubai to Amman on the A380-800. First time flying the EK A380! Again, boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. The aircraft was definitely newer (registration A6-EOU). ICE version was newer and screen was much bigger. Still a 3-4-3 configuration however much more comfortable than the 777. Just like the previous flight, no menus were given and there was only 1 meal choice. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Dubai and arrival in Amman was only 3 minutes late. I was seated in seat 78K. Baggage claim at AMM was abysmal! I wonder if the problem lies with Emirates or the baggage handling system at AMM. I can’t really give them much blame due to the fact that the aircraft was an A380, but waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes for baggage delivery is still unacceptable! Also, in my opinion, Emirates should really rethink boarding times. Boarding an aircraft 45 minutes prior to scheduled departure time surely guarantees a delay. On EK 856, pushback was not until 15 minutes after scheduled departure time and on EK 903, pushback was not until 13 minutes after scheduled departure time! In my opinion, boarding should begin 60 minutes prior to scheduled departure time. Also, Emirates should grant its aircraft a 2-hour turn-around time slot. This would give 1 hour to clean and prep the aircraft for boarding and an additional hour to complete boarding, ensuring an on-time departure.",Boeing 777-300 ER & A380-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kuwait to Amman via Dubai,07/08/19,yes,Trip Verified,8.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,Boeing 777-300ER
"""The worst cabin service""",Business,07/04/19,Australia,"  Dubai to Manchester. The worst cabin service I have experienced on any airline. At great expense I took the flight from Dubai to Manchester yesterday, excited to be trying a business class seat on the A380. I fly often but I have to say this was the worst cabin crew I have ever experienced on any airline. I feel as if I paid for them to have a great holiday. I know that other passengers felt the same way. We were all SO upset that we talked to each other about it both on the plane and afterwards. From the moment of boarding, there was no usual warm welcome. I was greeted by a very grumpy hostile cabin attendant. When she brought the breakfast menu later she couldn’t answer simple questions about the ingredients. “I can’t say”. “Could you please find out?” “No, the meal is precooked, we can’t tell”. I have never had that response before. The crew stood and sat at the back chatting away having a great time. There were many of them and few passengers. A perfect opportunity to showcase individual, fantastic service. Unfortunately, the head of the cabin crew was at the back chatting with them all – so there was little leadership. After complaints from passengers, nothing changed. On take-off they did not remove our glasses, on landing they did not check that we were strapped in, they did not remove our cups and glasses once again. I choked on my breakfast and tried to call for help. I waved and pressed the service button. No one came. I managed to scramble out of my seat, balance my tray on the side and get to the bathroom where I vomited. The food was appalling, dry and over cooked. My tea was served cold. The attendant was so grumpy, rude and unhelpful that I actually asked her whether she’d had bad news from home. She said “I am tired!” I paid thousands of very hard-earned money for this flight – it is not the passengers’ job to do the work of the tired, disgruntled crew! They kept one toilet locked. They did not walk through the cabin to see if the passengers were ok. They did not help the mother with her 3 year old across the aisle from me.

The Emirates lounge at Birmingham airport is spacious and well stocked and was only an equally short walk to the gate. Boarding was prompt and I will shown to my seat. There was a good choice of food and it was well served. My only criticism would have been the delay in bringing a glass of wine, forgetting my post-flight drink and having to ask to top it up. Apart from that the food was delicious and in a reasonable portions. The first A380 had the new design for the bar and there was a friendly group of passengers. The transfer at Dubai was quick and painless although allowing both economy and business passengers to exit through the same time did add some delay to exiting the aircraft. The flight to Bangkok was overnight and I chose to sleep. With the mattress, the seat was comfortable and I managed to sleep for a good three hours before being awoken for breakfast. The Wi-Fi connection on the plane was surprisingly stable and fast and there were enough movies to keep me entertained.

I had booked a chauffeur drive at 13.05 on 03 June with pick up point and location details clearly marked on the map while booking online. After numerous calls with Driver, Call Center of Emirates nobody showed up to pick me up even after 13.45pm.

Cabin crew informed me if am fasting then food will be served when it’s time to break my fasting but I should order the food in advance so that I get served. When it was time of breaking my fasting I asked for the food that was ordered in advance and very surprisingly crew told sorry we can’t serve the food and you need to adjust with a small sandwich box as we are planning to land. When I questioned crew why did they promised me to order food in advance and how can they deny serving the food for a fasting person then crew simply said it’s our policy and we can’t help. When I became furious then they simply gave me a quick main course to eat but I felt their frustration while getting served. I wasn’t served the food which I had preordered despite crew having enough time (around one hour was left to land the flight).

All economy passengers seated on the 2 aisle are boarded through the front door and has to pass through business class to get to their seat. As a business class passenger this means a lot of noise and commotion, no service until boarding is complete and being hit several times by carry on luggage.

Once checked in we (finally) didn’t have to go to the payment counter for overweight luggage since we had around 40KG baggage allowance.

"""a top notch experience""",Business,05/22/19,Thailand,"  Bangkok to Brussels via Dubai. I've flown them roughly every three years or so for the last two decades and they seem as good as ever. They're not perfect, and some other carriers have done a good job of catching up (particularly in economy class) but Emirates is still one of the better choices. The check in team and gate agents are efficient and patient. I had a problem with my mobile boarding pass not scanning and they were able to print me a new paper one with a smile. The aircraft was an older 777, but still mostly functional--there was a problem with the seat recline on my second segment. The entertainment system is good, but trying to cater to every culture they serve means the pool of options for English is pretty shallow. I was able to keep myself entertained, but just barely. Comedy is a weak spot for sure. The two hours of free wifi is good, but the connection is pretty poor. Emirates food is decent, though one flight only had an option of lamb or cod. Those are both rather specific tastes, I'd have been happier if they had gone with at least one safer choice of beef, chicken, or pasta. But the food was good and the desserts definitely stand out. Emirates doesn't stack up to the Asian carriers in terms of frequently circulating with water between meals, but the crew seemed service focused enough that you would get some if you asked. Connecting in Dubai is not a great experience. It's not as horrible as Doha but there is an amazing lack of plumbing in the airport, ensuring long lines at the toilets. Add to that some really extensive walks to get from gate to gate, and I'd be wary of advising any mobility impaired friends to try this without assistance. The flights were close to on time, but both arrived a little bit late without any logical explanation--no headwinds, ATC delays, or other obvious issues.

I have flown with Emirates on and off for years, and you can really see cost cutting and staff attitudes changing, on my flights anyway. Their bar service is non existent more or less, you get offered a drink with your meal, and thats about it, if you want a drink of anything you have to keep ring for service, which most folk like myself dont like to do. No hot towels on getting on the craft, your just left, food has notably gone down in quality too! On the second leg of the flight, it was a 4.20am takeoff, we were left without so much as a drink of water for 3 hours, i had medication to take and asked them for water, , they must have a water shortage! It was brought in an eggcup size cup. Eventually got brought a substandard breakfast, which has been so chilled its lost all its flavour, no alcohol offered on this flight. The service has massively changed, you can really see it is like the staff cant be bothered, just wanna chuck the food at you, so they can rest and talk in the galley. I paid £700 for my flight and felt ripped off, it would put me off travelling with them again. However, it is very handy from Newcastle upon Tyne to get a bit further afield, come on Emirates, get your act together!

"""disappointed about the quality""",Couple Leisure,05/16/19,Czech Republic,"  Prague to Bangkok via Dubai. I am very disappointed about the quality and service provided by the Emirates. It started at the check-in desk where I have checked 1 luggage and explicitly asked the staff member as I carry a lot of camera, lens, cables etc, if I can have drone (small size) with me in cabin bag. I was told yes, you don`t have to have it in checked baggage. Then at the security check right before the boarding gate I was told and forced to put drone into checked luggage, but I was not provided any bag for that and that I have to take care of it myself that it`s my mistake I was told by Emirates staff at the gate, BUT thanks to local security officers on airport (not emirates staff) They helped me to find bag, some papers and airbags to secure the drone. I said OK nice start, but then it continued with the service onboard. The menu was served after 2 hours after the take off and no walkaround of staff around. No water offer, only if you come by person to staff asking for water or something. The food was average - good taste, selection of 2 main food chicken vs beef and drinks. I asked for a beer and I was told they run out of beer. so I asked for Gin and Soda, and I was told, I dont have it with me but if you wait 10-15 minutes I will get it right back for you, and I waited approx 20 mins to get the gin and tonic. You can see attached picture of the snack we were offered, and I was like really, you can select small pretzels or kitkat?

The only let down was that they served Moet and not Veuve Cliquot which was what was previously on offer. On board the cabin layout of 3-2-3 was disappointing and the seat comfort was not good. However the aircraft was very clean and well maintained. The service to start off was a bit hit and miss, although did improve after the meal service. Champagne on board again was only Moet.

"""the biggest disappointment was the food""",Business,05/12/19,United Arab Emirates," First time for a long time with Emirates - normally I would use Etihad, and first time A380 business class. Overall, a curates's egg. However, you come to expect more from Emirates particularly given the cost of their flights. The good points: check in and bag delivery was excellent, as was the chauffeur service to / from DXB. The cabin appeared spotless, though all was not as it seemed. The crew were immaculate and charming if a little robotic. The quibbles: boarding at DXB was chaotic. It should not take nearly 2 hours to clear queuing passengers into the gate, the flight eventually leaving 90 minutes behind schedule. On the flight to CAN I was not welcomed onboard, or offered a drink, or a drink order taken on the return. If paying top dollar there is an expectation FAs keep tabs on their assigned passengers. However, the biggest disappointment was the food. I'd pre-ordered vegetarian. On the outward leg I was presented what I considered at the time to be the most uninspired slop I'd seen in nearly 50 years of flying, boiled mixed vegetables in a tasteless sauce on couscous. Until my return flight, that is. A 'dish' of boiled noodles with a squirt of neat tomato puree on top and accompanies by half a dozen near raw peas in their pods. The excellent sweet did not compensate. The FA apologized and offered any selection from the menu as an alternative. Trouble is, unlike other full fare airlines, including for economy class (Etihad), Emirates offers no vegetarian - or vegan - options. One assumes Emirates' management would rather vegetarians stay away. Henceforth I shall duly support this policy. I strongly recommend other vegetarians do likewise. Finally, I enjoy watching wildlife programmes as part of IFE. What I appreciate less is being 'entertained' through the night by the antics of a cockroach presumably making its way home through my seating area disappearing into the seat recess in front. Where there's one there'll be many more.

A couple of gripes on their Boeing 777 from Mumbai - Dubai - flown 07 March 2019. Inattentive cabin crew - No response to hostess call bell multiple times, had to verbally call out for assistance.  No water provided on boarding the aircraft and you had to ask for water and that also was cheaply been distributed in open plastic glasses the way they do it by the road side in India pouring out of packaged drinking water bottles. For more than an hour no water or snacks were offered and the food that was served was average and that was it, no munchies or a bottle of water before the dinner was served. Getting a glass of juice was a challenge and everything was being served very stingily. 5The flight seats are of very poor width since the flight is crammed with lot many seats per row, the food tray could barely fit on it. Uncomfortable aisles and poor comfort overall. The positive -  The inflight entertainment and camera view, that was the only saving grace.  Comparatively new flight and clean upholstery.

"""this flight was disgusting""",Business,05/12/19,United Kingdom," What happened on EK-001 on 9th May 2019? I've flown Emirates many times with excellent service, but this flight was disgusting. I get a special meal, gluten free, so my food arrived 30 mins before the general rush, then the normal food distribution. The food trays were then left (on people's laps) for maybe '4 hours'. This made it awkward to get up as one had to ask a neighbour to hold your tray plus their tray to go the toilet. I plan my in-flight experience down to exactly which seat and which meal, to minimise inconvenience, but this didn't work on EK-001 (09/05/19). Drinks trolleys were abandoned opposite toilets making for less space to stand. The flight standard was all the worse because I had just got off the excellent flight from Perth, Australia, arriving at gate A1 departing gate A3. It was such a shock coming from a serene feeling on a flight inbound to their Dubai hub, and the excellent experience in their hub, plus the great flights out to Australia. It genuinely felt as if the stewards were on strike.

"""very, average service""",Solo Leisure,05/10/19,United Kingdom,"  After 1 month in Thailand and the prospect of coming home to rainy Scotland, I decided to treat myself and upgrade my original economy ticket to business class. Okay I'll get all the positives out the way first. Great lounge at BKK, fully stocked with drinks and all the food I had was very tasty and prepared to a high standard. Seat and all the amenities that come with it were spot on, this is for the A380. The B777 is a more cramped affair altogether, so if you can, fly on the A380 - this applies to economy as well. I loved relaxing at the A380 bar area, watching the football on the big screen, whilst enjoying a freshly made cocktail, bliss! Now the negative, yes, just one, but it's a biggie and that would be the service. Now, don't get me wrong, there were some very pleasant FA's, albeit a bit false but as for the others it's the reason I won't fly Emirates again. After dinner I had a full glass of champagne in front of me, the FA tried to snatch it away, I don't understand this and why would you not ask the customer if they are finished? Needless to say, I snatched it back, much to the FA's annoyance, forgive me for wanting to finish my drink when I'm paying good money. Another point is the staff just hanging around the bar towards the end of the flight, as thought it was their own staff room, I wanted to just chill and spend the last couple hours of my flight reading my book but this just totally put me off. I work in hospitality myself and believe those areas are for the customer and the customer only not for staff to drape themselves over. Upon arrival at the lounge in Dubai, I gave my ticket to receptionist and as I was off a flight and a bit tired I made the heinous mistake of going the wrong way ""Where are you going sir"" was said to me in the tone of ""what are doing you complete and utter buffoon"", not pleasant in the slightest, such a sour character and one you wonder why bother working with the public? So in a nutshell, great food, IFE, seats etc etc. But very, average service, bordering on downright rude at times. For this reason I'll be trying Singapore in future and avoiding Emirates entirely.

"""does not get a recommendation""",Business,04/18/19,United Kingdom,"  Gatwick to Manila via Dubai. Was recommended by a colleague to fly Emirates business class. What I was surprised about was I experienced 2 very different business class products – I was totally shocked at the difference. London to Dubai was on an Airbus and Dubai to Manila a Boeing 777. The Airbus flight was aligned to business class travel expectations, seat was reasonably comfortable, large selection of IFE, food was of a good quality. My only quibbles were the seat belt length seemed quite short – it was tight on me and not something I experienced on other airlines; staff helped when asked but otherwise didn’t offer. The Boeing product is significantly inferior – uncomfortable seating and it was not lie flat, no storage at all, 2-3-2 configuration, no amenity kit etc, slow food service with a very limited selection. The Boeing flight is like flying premium economy – a good amount of leg room and a wider seat (seat belt size was much longer) but that’s as much as I can positively say about it. It was a really uncomfortable flight for me given it was close to 9 hours – I felt cheated for having paid for a business class seat. Regrettably, I had 2 more business class flights that week with Emirates which were not refundable otherwise I would have cancelled. Flew HKG to Dubai on an Boeing 777 - just as bad (if not worse) than the Manila flight. What storage existed was used by the cabin staff, myself and 2 other passengers had to store our cabin bags several rows behind us in a single overhead – we had to do this ourselves, no help or interest from cabin staff. Food was awful. Lounge in Dubai served excellent food and beverages and had some nice quiet seating areas. However, if you wanted some F&B getting it was a bit of a challenge - I witnessed only 2 serving stations for main courses and tea/coffee - despite being there for over an hour, never did manage to be able to get through the endless throng to get a cup of tea.

It was obvious Emirates had chosen the the cheapest possible configuration that you would expect on a budget domestic airline. The seats were super low quality and grubby. There was next to no padding which made it painful for a 14 hour flight. The air was dry, but worse is the LED lighting which has a low Hz flicker.

On the way back it was the opposite, it wouldn’t recline at all. The food service also has dropped a lot with the quality of the meal service and the portions which have become similar to what you get on a Low cost.

I had heard good things about this airline in the past so decided to give it a go. Baggage drop-off at Gatwick was fine. The gate at Gatwick was horrible, a small space to accommodate all economy class passenger of an A380. Most of us had to stand for a long time before boarding commenced as the seating at the gate were totally inadequate. My seat on the A380 was comfortable but the IFE did not work. The seat would not recline either. The stewardess tried to help but ended up apologizing for the broken IFE and seat. The meal service was good and the quality of food reasonable, however, the portion sizes were very small. The flight from Dubai to Islamabad was not good at all. Boarding at Dubai was chaotic, Most passengers were not allowed to take their hand luggage on board with them as according the staff at the gate the flight was full and there would not be enough space on the plane for hand luggage despite the fact that most people had just one item of hand luggage with them. The boarding process took a long time and the gate staff didn't seem too bothered. The seats on Boeing 777-300ER were extremely uncomfortable, the legroom was very tight and the seat width was also very cramped. Shortly after boarding completed, the cabin lights were switched off with on the screens and seat belt signs providing any light. The captain announced that we would be delayed due to heavy traffic along our flight path. No cabin crew were around to answer any queries and any calls for them were ignored. We eventually left Dubai over an hour late. The rest of the flight was unremarkable. The crew were not very friendly and didn't seem too bothered.

I've heard many pros about the airline from my friends who have flown with Emirates and an ex-Emirates stewardess. What I experienced, is the opposite of what they told me.

This time, the ICE worked well, and was more advanced than the old crap in the 777. Unfortunately, the cabin crew were rude and they didn't care about the passengers as much as the cabin crew in KLM or even AirAsia. I saw them only when twice when they gave food to the pax. On the way back to Oslo, I ordered Vegetarian meal. I was shocked, when they came with a Vegan meal. Is it so hard to see the difference? All other airlines offer vegeterian food or even lacto-ovo vegetarian etc. Also, I don't recommend the meal for those who are Vegans. It was really disgusting, and it was too warm.

Not only did Emirate not indicate at any time during the booking process about this law they refused to reason when I showed them South African's government recent update.

The lounge at T3 heathrow was fine but then we arrived to find a plane which whilst cannot be that old given its an A380, was seemingly falling apart. People’s seats didn’t work properly, my TV was broken, and the bar area looked terrible. The cabin crew seemed like they’d just been assembled at the last moment - the service levels were atrocious and disinterested. The food, particularly the child options, were like warm and very average.

"""crew stoic, tired looking""",Solo Leisure,02/19/19,Bahrain," Dubai to Bahrain. So we all know that economy gets you from A to B, safely and we are not expecting much especially with a short hop like this, only a one hour flight. Paid for a extra room seat at Door 3, 24 D being an aisle on the B777. Flight was very full with many children and to their credit two of the crew were very engaging with them and their parents. What I do not get is why Emirates insist on placing ten across high density on all their B777 aircraft - an industry norm these days but it begs belief. As the crew went up and down the aisle I was knocked into over 12 times in less than an hour and I am 78 Kg, some at least had the courtesy to apologize, most did not bother. I get its cattle class but I for one would never set foot on these aircraft in this high density. I find EK crew to be stoic, tired looking, the crew member at my door crew seat looked as if he dying for his bed, head in his hands, yawned non stop and a lot of the crew looked plain disinterested. This is obviously down to crew planning being over stretched. Overall ok, flight deck did a great job with announcements and the flight itself and landing was excellent - true skill.

As a very frequent emirates passenger in the past, we have nor used the economy Emirates product for over 4 years. Check in was laborious as a they were checking everyone’s visas which is understandable. Boarding was good. No issues both in AMS or DXB. Onboard service is now a huge let down. On both sectors after take off it took 2 hours before the food service was started. And at no point was a bar service offered. Not just alcohol beverages but water or soft drinks. The food was below average and it was only after the food was eaten the bar service came out. I can on Y assume that Emirates is trying to cut back and save money. But what they don’t realise is the majority of there traffic is in Economy and if you keep cutting the service then people will stop booking. Especially when the completion like Qatar or Etihad offer better service on the same routes. We will not be booking with Emirates economy in the near future as it is not a pleasurable experience anymore. Also I felt the ICE was of a reduced choice as compared to a few years ago.

Great hard product but the soft product on Emirates is just simply lacking and its down to the crews who are at best very lackadaisical. You have a few who are superb but on the whole it reflects a training problem. Much noise and chat going on which is very annoying during the night routes. One thing I have never seen and clearly much revelry goes on in the Emirates dorms. One female FA groped the boob of another in a playful manner. Now for red hot blooded males this may be fine but sorry this is a major flag carrier. Whilst on the Emirates gripe. The IFE is fine but to be honest was struggling too find some films that really appealed. Emirates caters for a huge language base. Final gripe. The seat quality certainly in economy is dire.

"""gets away with sloppy standards""",Business,02/05/19,Australia,"  Sydney to Madrid via Dubai. Being a Qantas FF I occasionally travel on Emirates but with a Qantas code on it. Now same aircraft (A380) but the whole experience is totally different. Have been on Emirates a few times a year mostly when routing to a Europe port other than London. Sydney being the Qantas home base is these days very efficient to get through. Self check in (even though i can use the First counter) and through security and to the Qantas lounge in probably 15 minutes. The Emirates version is very different and rightly so as it is not home base. The economy line up was massive. Fortunately could use the premium line and was through swiftly. Time for Emirates to start using self check in. Used the superb Qantas First Lounge and then moved over to the Emirates lounge which was a very pleasant place. From there the whole experience was pretty dismal. Had a whole row to myself in the main cabin which was great. Same sights and sounds as for the Qantas A380 but its the customer service that lets Emirates down. They just simply have recruited too many young kids who just dont have the professionalism or charm of the slightly older crews on Qantas main line. Its really a training problem. Having crew that speak 30 languages on board is fine but does not help if their manner is to put it mildly rather brusque. Charm school is sorely missing. Mid flight snacks are poor to non existent. Food is a little underwhelming. Delayed start from Sydney due to bad weather and a tight connection meant a run through Dubai T3 to get to the Madrid flight. Same plane, different crew but same lack of charm and professionalism. And Emirates...one other thing. Please do not have your crews take away blankets, act as general cleaners and so on around 30 minutes before landing. It jut is not a great look. Overall the airline needs to employ proper training methods or better still get some older crew who can teach the young ones how to. The fact is that Emirates gets away with sloppy standards since they have a great network, hard product in the A380, great airport in Dubai. For me it is the easiest way to get to Madrid from Sydney so have to get used to a substandard level of service which many people have commented on.

During checkin on the airport I've asked to window seat and I got this seat in emergency row. Also my baggage has been sent without extra costs (I had extra 6kg). At the terminal I've paid to lounge contracted with Emirates airline but it wasn't worth this price (250 DKK, around 33EUR). Boarding at the gate was late around 30 minutes but during this process there was good order, people was queued in the groups. Service on board was good but nothing special comparing to other airlines, meal choice was poor (only dishes with rice). Very good and very stable entertainment system with big selection of movies and games. Also GSM and WIFI network available onboard (I didn't use them at all due to nice passengers travelling next to me, we talked all the time).

Unfortunately for us Emirates messed up multiple times. The flight was delayed, that might be a normal safety measure. But then we got no information or wrong information all the way. It’s a wrong strategy to do so with Emirates, as they can mess up your trip fully, and won’t give you more than a poor meal (free poor meal). They can tell you that you will get refunded for your additional expenses and then decline later. All the way to Jakarta, we asked to sleep in Dubai, in Emirates lounge maybe? Explaining we were losing our hotel. The day of departure, after delay notification: Support chat: “I don’t know”. Emirates Barcelona ground service: “I can’t give you anything in Dubai, you should ask there. But you will get the 600 euros indemnity each for severe delay, it should cover all your expenses, in case anyway.""  At Emirates Dubai ground service: “Hi, can we sleep somewhere? We are really tired? - Here is your meal voucher. - But we would like to sleep, we are tired, we are not hungry, really. Can we go to the lounge, maybe? - Yeah.. maybe, try there, here is your meal voucher”. We needed to sleep, we paid the hotel in the airport, around 200 USD. We do the online complaint to Emirates.

Traveling alone with my 10 month old son, the cabin crew were amazing. Introduced themselves personally and took my son for walks through the plane, gave him a meal & toys, and took a Polaroid keepsake. The flight wasnt full so I had the 4 seats to myself with the bassinet and when someone moved to the aisle seat after takeoff, Natasha said she would find the passenger an alternative seat for both our comfort levels (which was unnecessary but great). Unfortunately, the Dubai-Adelaide leg was terrible. I waited nearly 1.5 hours after takeoff to get the bassinet put up, then during the flight which was really turbulent (not much can be done about that I know), I had to buzz for my food trays to be removed as they sat there for a few hours. An elderly man was I'll in the toilet near where I was seated, and had opened the door whilst doubled over the sink vomiting, so again I buzzed for assistance for him but nobody even came! 2 female crew had an argument in the aisle about 1 getting a food order wrong, and it was just very unprofessional. Had it not been for the assistance of the passenger on the aisle and behind me helping me to reach the overhead compartment etc as i needed nappies and things during the flight, but had my son in my arms for almost 10 of the 12 hours due to the turbulence so was attempting to function using 1 hand, the flight would have been a worse experience.

"""we couldn't sit together""",Couple Leisure,12/11/18,United Kingdom,"  London to Brisbane via Dubai. Our flight from London Heathrow was late, which resulted in us rushing through the transit to book in for the next connecting flight from Dubai to Brisbane (via Singapore). When we arrived at the Dubai check in, it was apparent that there was something wrong but the Emirates staff just talked amongst themselves. After some 15 or 20 other passengers checked in after us for the same flight (5 of them Business Class customers) the Emirates staff told us that they had changed our seats and we couldn't sit together, but they offered no reason for this, I told the staff that we had booked these seats and my partner was a nervous flyer so we could not sit in separate locations. They said you have no choice, I asked to be upgraded to 1st class, they refused, I offered to travel on the next flight 02.30hrs (some 5 hours later), I was abruptly told that our luggage was on the flight that we were originally booked on (21.15hrs) and we needed to board that flight as it was departing in a few minutes. Their attitude for Business Class customers (or any customer) was deplorable. We arrived at Brisbane, but our luggage didn't, the staff at Brisbane were helpful but couldn't tell us where it was, as it hadn't been 'scanned in' at Dubai. I then got access to text messages on my mobile phone, which I couldn't obtain whilst on the flights, for some reason, the text read 'due to operational reasons we have had to transfer you to the flight that departs from Dubai at 02.30hrs', why didn't the staff at Dubai know about this instead of refusing me travel on this service, especially when I had offered to do just that. We waited at Brisbane, for the next flight to arrive, but still no luggage. It took Emirates 3 days to get our luggage to us, by this time we had travelled to Cairns as this was how we had booked our holiday and accommodation. On our return flight to London, which departed from Melbourne, we checked in and the staff said 'due to the flight being full we have changed your seats', from Dubai to London. I couldn't understand why this would be necessary just because the flight was full, again I refused this and asked to be upgraded, no was the reply. We then had to wait at the customer service desk and they eventually explained that they had e mailed Dubai and we had got our original seats, although the staff pointed out to me that the seats were only a request and not guaranteed, I showed them an email from Emirates which confirmed the flight and seat details, from the outset of the booking. The Emirates customer service desk operative made a point that she had done us a favour, in getting our original seats back. When we arrived at Dubai check in, again we were faced with 'we have changed your seats'. I couldn't believe this and again had to wait and argue to get our original seats. The staff on the plane were very attentive and polite on all legs, but the staff on the ground just don't care, rude and not worthy of the Emirates uniform. I asked several times 'how much do you want me to pay before you start giving us some level of service' I have written to Emirates with the complaint and incredibly they have referred it to Qantas, because Emirates were only operating the flight on their behalf, how that works when it was the Emirates staff who caused the issues I don't know.",A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,London to Brisbane via Dubai,12/11/18,no,Trip Verified,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,A380-800

The first leg on Sunday 25th November 2018 (Manchester -Dubai) was excellent, the crew were attentive and very pleasant. The next leg (Dubai-Singapore) was less pleasant the crew less attentive. The return flights (8th December)were much more unpleasant the aircraft was full on both legs but that should not have had any bearing on the complete lack of interest that the crew displayed. On the first leg my wife felt as though she was about to vomit, I went with her to the back of the plane and asked a member of the crew for some advice (He was chatting to two other crew members at the time) his response was to point to a toilet at the rear and said “Sick bags in the restroom” no other concern was expressed. The leg from Dubai to Manchester was over night leaving Dubai at 2.55am for at least three hours we saw no crew at all, anything we needed had to be requested by a visit to the curtained off galley. Overall we were extremely disappointed by the standard of service, far less than we expected. The uniforms of the crew are probably the smartest in the business but along with this must go an equivalent level of customer service.

What kind of flight crew training does EK provide, where a Captain thinks it is OK to let passengers sit in silence on a flight delayed 3+ hours, yet make only 2 incorrect announcements? After sitting for 3.5 hours the Captain direct all passengers to collect their belongings & deplane. So 100's of passengers deplane, but those in 1st & Business Class on the upper deck had another surprise waiting. Neither the Captain, or the flight crew had alerted ground staff that upper deck passengers had been directed to deplane. As a result, all 1st & Business Class passengers were crammed at the end of the jetway in front of the 2nd floor elevators, with no place to go! Passengers could enter the elevators, but security had disabled the floor selection buttons after the plane had originally boarded. Passengers started to bang on the glass walls to try & get the attention of security staff who could be seen in the distance, but unable to hear through the heavy glass walls. Passengers finally returned to the plane to tell the ""totally clueless"" flight crew, there was no place to go & passengers were trapped in the small  2nd floor area. Security personnel finally noticed passengers banging on the wall & 1 unlocked a 5th floor door & came to the 2nd level via stairwell, since they also could not operate the elevators. This employee then directed all 1st & Business Class passengers to carry all their belongings up 6 flights to the 5th floor Business Class Lounge! What a fiasco of total incompetence. The flight ended up being 5.5 hours late, but once airborne, passengers quickly learned that even though the plane had sat at the gate for almost 6 hours, it had not been re-catered, so the flight was serving a ""breakfast"" menu, even though the flight departed at almost 4:00PM. No dinner would be served, but rather a light snack, since the menu was still for the ""original"" flight times. After flying for 25 years, I have never experienced a more incompetent flight operation. Not 1 EK employee mentioned any compensation, even though  passengers should have received some type of compensation!

I had to pay an extra $85 for hotel and approximately $50 for meals. As it is, I paid $1,609.54 originally for the ticket which I thought was overpriced and an additional $375 in penalties and fare difference for changing my return date.

Service onboard was quite bad, food was average, flight attendants were rude, the purser spent the whole flight shouting at the crew. They never asked if we wanted more bread or more cafe etc. The flight from Dubai to Male was scheduled at 3:15 am, so we wanted nothing but sleep. Even if we put on all of our ""resting stuff"" the flight crew woke up us at 5 am for breakfast. She said that she must assure that everyone on board was offered breakfast. On our return flights we found another surprise. As the travel agency gave us the booking reference two months ago I purchased the seats, as the fare the agency took did not allow to choose seats. I paid 140€ for the seats. So far so good until we checked in at Male airport. Our seats were changed with no reason. In both flights (MLE-DXB and DXB-MAD). The handling staff could not tell me any reasonable reason, and the finished with a great ""ask Emirates staff when you arrive to Dubai"". Great answer from a professional employee. But when I tried to get an explanation at Dubai my luck did not get better: after twenty minutes trying to hold a conversation, one person who supposedly was in charge gave me a piece of paper with a web site written and told me to fill an online claim.

However, I am required to highlight that personal belongings brought onboard are the responsibility of each individual passenger, and the airline cannot accept responsibility for loss of, or damage to, personal items. According to our records, as you were sitting in the bulkhead row, you were advised that all bags and loose items have to be stowed for landing in the overhead lockers. It is my understanding that you did not inform the cabin crew that your bags contained fragile items. Notwithstanding the above, we certainly appreciate you bringing your experience to our attention, and I wish to assure you that your comments, along with the Cabin Supervisor's report, have been shared with the departments concerned. This enables them to take appropriate internal action to improve the standard of service offered to our customers. I can also advise that the cabin crew operating in Economy class on this flight have received guidance in this regard. Please accept my apologies for not having met your expectations on this occasion. I hope that we can leave you with a more positive impression on your future flights with us.

Online Check-in should be standard and Emirates offers it. However, the Website is hard to navigate and it takes ages to load. Then, two of us (two out of five) could not check in online. So we went to the airport and checked in the classic way. We were checking in four hours prior to departure. The first Check-in agent was really friendly, but unfortunately, she handed us over to a colleague who was rude. We tried to get seats near each other, she said no seats available.  There are hundreds of people in the queue behind us and you tell us they all have seats and you can't change it? They didn't all do the online check-in because there were seperate queues. So we don't get seats near each other, okay. We go to the gate and there is the next problem: There is a pre-boarding area. They had to get us out of there two hours before departure. It was a mess. There, they could suddenly magically change our seats. So ground service seems to be good or bad depending on your fortune. So the flight was normal. Legroom was okay but not outstanding. Recline of the seat wasn't working. The meal was great. IFE had a awesome choice, but unfortunately there was two minutes of ads before every film. When we arrived in DXB, we went to the costumer service to ask if we could get seats near each other since we were spread all over the plane. The staff was again rude and not motivated at all. She said she could not do anything for us. We got to the gate and picked up some free ice cream form Emirates (That was great, keep it up!) on the way. There was again this strange kind of first stage boarding. It was a mess. When I got my boarding pass scanned, the agent told me I've got an upgrade. Now, I don't want to complain about the upgrade, but why didn't they tell us at costumer service? They scanned our boarding passes there, and all in all three of us five go an upgrade, one of which had a gluten free meal. So they have planned the upgrade in advance.

"""have 19kg excess baggage""",Family Leisure,09/04/18,Oman,"  Muscat to Guangzhou via Dubai. Everything was good in the inbound flight and there was no issue. On the other hand, my outbound flight had many issues. First of all, the agents who handled the check in were not polite and knowledgeable of English so that they can understand passengers and passengers can understand them. I had an agent who told me that I have 19kg excess baggage while I was sure that I have checked the baggage three times in my hotel and they were with in the limit. I asked the agent to double check and put them on the scale again individually since he was putting them all together and hand calculating the total weight. The agent refused to do so and refused to ask for his supervisor to come and kept saying ""It is Dubai, Check with Dubai"" He was about to return all the bags to me until I make the payment, I told him Ok check the bags and finish the check in so that my family and I will go and do the payment. He said ""first make payment and then will check the bags""! He kept my family standing there with my children and I went to do the payment. When I asked the other agent also to go and check or ask that guy in the counter to check she refused and said the same ""check with Dubai"". I paid the $570 for 19kg which I really think it is ridiculously insane charge for 19kg. In front of the gate, several agents were collecting the carry on bags to check them in for free and they did check all my carry on bags that weighs more than 20kg. Then they asked to take my cabin friendly baby stroller to check in because they where not aware of this type of strollers, although I informed them about it and showed them how it folds but they did not listen and they were unaware of this type of stroller. I purchased this type so that baggage handling dont break my stroller. They lost one of my baggage and I could not get it before the Eid. Even some cheap airlines gives food that is better than the food served in Emirates airlines and they served the same food in both flights although they were in different times.

"""disappointed with Emirates""",Family Leisure,08/11/18,United Kingdom,"  Totally disappointed with Emirates on the flights from Manchester to Dubai, and from Dubai to Manchester on the way back. Flights to and from Singapore the cabin crew were very good but airplane was old and some of the touch screens were not working and also the seats were not very good. The experience at Manchester airport was horrendous- that wasn’t the airlines fault. Once we got onto plane the plane though the experience didn’t improve the stewards and stewardesses looked bored and could not be bothered with passengers. When they did come round it felt as though they were just completing jobs without a care as to how they do it! Also noticed that the kids meals were not presented as they used to be 2 years ago when I last traveled with them. Dubai to Manchester on the 31st of July- firstly flight we had booked was supposed to be from Singapore to Colombo and then to Dubai, they had overbooked and as a result offered us a direct flight from Singapore to Dubai which we didn’t have an issue with. Flight from Dubai was a different story the cabin staff looked depressed and really difficult to deal with. You would ask nicely but their responses were really short and every time it was a no! Having had 3 children with us they were given breakfast part of which was cereal, all 3 were given different cereals which caused problems as they all wanted the same one, when the air stewardess was asked if she could check if there was this particular cereal available her answer was no straight away without even checking. Overall we just feel as a family in future we would rather travel long haul with other airlines as Emirates service was terrible and reading reviews we don’t appear to be the only ones. Emirates have started offering a saver fare which if you book be aware you will not be able to pre select your seats. Inflight entertainment was some of the worst I had seen - some of the movies were really old!

"""airline has deteriorated""",Family Leisure,08/09/18,United Kingdom,"  London to Manila via Dubai. Here is an airline that has deteriorated in a spectacular fashion. I have flown with Emirates since the late 90's and had not used them recently. I decided to use them this year. What a shock! This was not the Emirates that I used to know and liked immensely. Their aircraft are dirty and their staff, both on the ground and in the air, are inept and downright rude. In my particular case, i originally booked flights from Gatwick to Manila, via a two hour stopover in Dubai. After paying for the flights, Emirates emailed me to say that the schedules had changed and I was now on a flight from Heathrow with a one hour stopover in Dubai. To be honest, i was somewhat wary of such a tight connection time but I (in hindsight) stupidly trusted Emirates to get me to my destination on time. Well, the inevitable happened. The flight from Heathrow was delayed, thus causing me to miss my connecting flight to Manila. Incidentally, having checked this particular flight (EK004), it appears that it has been late departing from Heathrow virtually every evening. I would love to know how many other Manila bound passengers have missed their connection in this way over the last three months. The Emirates ground crew at Dubai were next to useless, accommodating us in a shabby hotel in Dubai for a few hours and then sticking us on a Hong Kong bound flight that evening, to connect with a Philippine Airlines flight the following morning. In short, a planned 17 hour, 1 stop journey became a 30 hour, 2 stop journey. I contacted Emirates and asked why we had not been placed on the direct flight from Dubai to Manila that evening. We would have still been late, but at least we would not have had to connect in Hong Kong. As yet, no answer. In fact, the response from Emirates has been condescending and wholly unsatisfactory. The Dubai ground crew and the Emirates customer service office give the impression that they are doing the delayed passengers a huge favour by shipping them out on a little bus to a Dubai hotel for a few hours and then placing them on later, non-direct flights. The customer services rep in his email to me even had the brass neck to point out how expensive it is for Emirates to re-book us on to another airline at Hong Kong.  Here's an idea Emirates, stop re-scheduling passengers on to flights with almost impossible connection times and get your passengers to their destinations as advertised. In conclusion, we missed a late evening meet up with friends in Manila and I had to fork out £160 for new internal flights to our final destination, as we had missed our original flights in Manila.

"""never fly Emirates again""",Couple Leisure,07/30/18,Australia,"  Barcelona to Melbourne via Dubai. At the recommendation of the cruise company we booked with, who said they receive a very good deal with Emirates we had them book our flights. Prior to leaving we phoned Emirates to arrange seat allocations, after this was done we were informed that we were to be charged an extra $200AUD for this booking. After complaining to the cruise company they did pay this cost. This is the first time we have ever had to pay for booking seat allocations on any airline we have travelled on overseas. As my wife has a medical condition that prevents her from eating anything spicy we checked out the food options with Emirates and their representative was very understanding and recommended that the best option was a Western Vegan Meal, this was confirmed in a email from them. On the flight to Dubai/ Rome WHAT happens, my wife's meal arrives and if not the sauces then whether the fish,chicken,beef or pork all come out with curry in it. Regardless of complaints no other option available, no spare standard meal either. However, on the Dubai to Rome section when the same meal problem arose the cabin crew supervisor asked us for our flight details and said she would arrange to cancel this ""vegan"" meal option and it would mean my wife would have the choice of the regular meals on our return flights home from Barcelona. Somewhere in cyberspace this arrangement still lingers, for on our flight from Barcelona history repeated itself. Once again, No spare meals available so as before my wife had a whatever I could give her off mine, likewise the same issue came up on the flight from Dubai to Melbourne. Just to add insult to injury, as we were seated near the galley we saw meal trays dropped on the floor and the noise coming from there was loud to say the least, also we feel the toilets could have been more regularly checked as the basins needed cleaning and toilet rolls replaced as well as refuse bins emptied. Seated next to me was a young man with a liking for gin and tonics, He was seen ordering ""doubles "" e.g. two bottles at a time and also helping himself to the bar which was parked behind our seats.

Boarding at FCO on the A380 now faster, smoother thanks to the new departure gate at FCO with dual level air stairs. Nice welcome on board by smiling, professional crew.

Someone says on earlier report that EK doesn't ask for feedback? There's a digital survey card contained within ICE or you can report your comments to one of the cabin supervisors. I did this as I wanted to comment on the fact that EK no longer offers a pre-lunch drinks service on this route instead combining the meal and cocktail service together. I understand why this is - some people want to eat as soon as they sit down - but it does make the initial part of the cabin service rather rushed, which is unnecessary on a 5.5 hour flight. In the past on this route ice cream was served about 4 hours into the flight but this has now been replaced with a sandwich and tea / coffee. Lunch, incidentally, was excellent (braised beef, gratin potatoes and the most delicious crumble for dessert), and I write that as someone who doesn't usually take the meal on this sector. Being extra picky here but it's a shame Campari is no longer offered as a cocktail in economy but good to note there was a selection of three different types of red wine.

Having travelled for much of the day and connected in HKG, I found it impossible to relax, the more so as the plane was being refuelled and the lighting full on. How come refuelling took place after the scheduled departure time given that our aircraft had arrived in HKG several hours earlier? Although hungry, I skipped dinner as midnight was just too late for me. All I wanted was try and sleep but even that was difficult with the short flight time.

At 8-9 hours per leg, this wasn't unexpected. The quality of the food was good. I had the gluten free meal and my partner the normal. Both flavour, variety and good portion sizes. I didn't feel like the gluten free option meant I had substandard food, so I would take this into account if you have any intolerances. The entertainment was very good. We were spoilt for choice for films and TV shows, and the inflight status was a nice extra. The larger screens were on two of our flights, and were much more responsive than the smaller, older versions on our other two flights. For the smaller screens, we just used the physical controllers, but these were easy enough to use too. All of the staff were highly professional, prompt and courteous. We had a few smiles as well.  All in all I'm very happy with my experience from Emirates. The flight weren't cheap at £580 return, but there were many cheaper options available.

"""Incompetence of check-in personnel """,Couple Leisure,04/16/18,Singapore,"  Sydney to Christchurch. Incompetence of Emirates check-in personnel that may cost me over $400 On April 8, 2018, my wife and I were travelling on EK412 from Sydney to Christchurch. We were carrying an expensive PC as a gift to our daughter for her graduation from the university that we purchased in Australia and we planned to claim tax refund. It’s a common knowledge (and a common sense, too) that goods need to be produced to a tax refund officer to obtain tax refund. To our knowledge, at Sydney Airport tax refund office is located beyond check-in, immigration and security and I intended to bring the PC there. The box was pretty bulky, and I was told that I had to check it in. It was a natural question that I asked the check-in assistant – how was I supposed to produce it to a tax refund officer if I do that. The junior assistant who was checking us in didn’t know the answer and asked her supervisor by name David. David assured us that producing receipt to a tax refund officer was sufficient to claim tax and that goods don’t need to be necessarily produced if they’re checked in, so we checked the box in along with our luggage. At the tax refund office, the officer requested me to produce the goods besides the receipt, which I was unable to do. The officer then said that I had to produce it to a tax refund officer located before check-in point, of which the airline should have informed me. When I replied that the airline advised me that the good don’t need to be produced to a tax refund officer and producing receipt alone is sufficient to claim tax refund, the officer still accepted my claim but it’s now up to decision of the main office in Canberra, whether I will receive tax refund after not being able to produce the goods. Thus, the incompetence of Emirates check-in personnel in matters of tax refund may cost me over $400 if my claim is ultimately not entertained.

On one of our seats the overhead light was not working and given this was a night flight needed. Whilst on the stand I reported this to a member of staff who told me that they could not move us to another seat as we were a couple. We had the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screens with random actions and scrolling cursors. The area we were seated in was extremely cold and my wife ended up using four of the airline blankets to try and be warm enough to get some sleep. I went for a walk around the economy area and found in all other areas the temperature was adequate. We appeared to be sat below an air con portal blowing cold air. This affected say ourselves and another dozen or so passengers who could be spotted by their huddled looks with coats and blankets. When I asked about this I was told that “Computer says” it’s 25 degrees. In our zone it was probably about 12 degrees. The member of staff was dismissive. It would have been bad enough if they had agreed but apologised that nothing could be fixed in-flight. I decided to seek the supervisor. In regards to the heating they did accept there was a fault and that staff should have not tried to ignore the issue. On the matter of the overhead light they said that we could have been reseated in row 50 as there was space at take off. They agreed with comments about the issues and the poor customer service. They said they would take immediate verbal action with staff in flight and would file a report regarding my issues at base. They presented me with a business card without names on and an email address to write to. On arrival in Cape Town I sent a comprehensive report to the alleged customer service email on the business card. I received a curt rejection pointing me to the on-line complaints form. Emirates customer complaints response indicates that their target is to respond in 30 days. Having heard nothing before we were heard nothing before we were due to fly back home.

After a long period of time the manager informed me that it was with the UK Customer Relations unit and still under investigation. To date still no contact some 37 days later. On the return trip home my wife encountered a problem with a member of staff pointing her finger to get out of the way effectively, without saying a word. Another poor PR exercise was a steward reading a tablet and in the hearing of others selecting a passenger individually and indicating they were a frequent customer and if there is anything I can do for you my name is...

I have flown Emirates many times and somehow they never manage to leave on time - and rarely do they make up for lost time. This flight for example landed 40 minutes past schedule. When you leave later and spend more time on board, details start to matter. Like for example how long it takes before meals are served. But even as important as when the meal trays are collected. The first they try to stall for obvious reasons, they used to serve 2 meals on these flights and now 1 and some crackers. The later they serve it, the less obvious the difference. The second causes unnecessary annoyance. When you’re in a window seat and have to wait for 1 hour and 40 minutes for them to clear the trays - and you have to use the toilet - you’re going to start having doubts about their service. Their crew are more occupied getting to know each other and sharing party stories than being involved in the service they should offer. In the absence of alternatives like Qatar Airways, you’re almost forced to fly Emirates to most of the Middle East, which is another annoyance.

The service and the food were as expected. The sky bar is a fantastic gimmick except if you want to sleep with your seat close to the bar. Choose a seat away from the bar if you want quiet. Our connecting flight departed from Terminal C which we did not particularly like. Lots of construction going on. The Emirates Lounge offers less amenities than the one in Terminal B. However, the food selection was excellent. The Dubai to Mumbai leg was a bit of a letdown. The plane looked rather old. The age of the airliner was particularly evident in the entertainment system. The screen resolution was that of the past decade, so underwhelming. The remote control still had a phone on one side which says it all. The service and the breakfast served were good however. After this experience we were worried that for the return leg to Dubai again and old 777-300ER would be used. Additionally, web check-in did not work and our hotel only reached their Mumbai office after trying all day. We did not know whether we would be seated together until we arrived at Mumbai airport. To our pleasent surprise we were seated together and the plane was much newer with excellent screens, the separate iPad and the remote control that looks like a Playstation portable. The range of Entertainment programs Emirates' ICE system offers is fabulous. We used the lounge in Terminal B which is superior to the one in Terminal C. An absolute highlight is the Moet and Chandon bar. Very friendly staff. The last leg from Dubai to Amsterdam was again an excellent experience with good food and friendly service.

"""service once again has fallen well short""",Couple Leisure,02/02/18,United Kingdom,"  Glasgow to Auckland via Dubai. Emirates fell very short of their much hyped quality service on the flight from Dubai to Auckland on 26 Dec 2017. I had the misfortune to fly with them from Dubai to Auckland. The ground staff were very rude and unhelpful in Dubai, it took an age to get our boarding passes checked and when I did eventually get to my allotted seat I found someone else sitting there with exactly the same boarding pass!! the airplane was pushing back for take off while I was still standing in the galley while the air crew were trying to find me a seat! what does that say about their Health and safety and security. Anyhow the killer was that after the 17 hour flight to Auckland we had to queue an extra 3 hours in the airport to record the fact that our bags had not arrived. In fact approximately 150 bags didn't make it to Auckland so there were massive queues. Emirates ground staff were totally unprepared despite the fact that Emirates knew for at least 17 hours that our bags would not arrive at the same time as us! They wasted a day of my holiday and limited what I could do on the following day as I had to be available to sign for the bags when they were eventually delivered. We were not the most inconvenienced passengers. There were others who missed their connection to south island and several people in wheelchairs also waiting in a queue for 3 hours with no refreshments offered or seating to help those less able to stand. Any organisation that was serious about delivering a quality service would have had sufficient staff available to process our basic details so that the missing luggage could be delivered and would have had seating refreshments for those who needed it. Whilst things can go wrong its how you deal with the mishaps that determines whether you deliver a quality service. I received no apology or compensation to make up for the inconvenience and loss of a days holiday caused by Emirates failure. so many lessons could be learned from this but I doubt it will. This cant be the first time they have had such a massive failure in the delivery of luggage. I've flown several times with Emirates and had to put up with everything from missed connections to having give up my seat so that the drunk the passenger next to me could be physically restrained  (a former Emirates crew member). not once have I received a formal apology or any compensation.

"""excellent choice on this route""",Solo Leisure,01/25/18,Thailand,"  Bangkok to Hong Kong. Emirates has changed the configuration of its daily Bangkok/Hong Kong return flight from 3 class to a reduced business class and substantially increased economy class. This results in a total of 615 passengers. The problem is that it is the front half of the upper deck that has been given over to economy resulting in premium passengers having to wait till these have disembarked before they can get off. Since lower deck passengers are also disembarking earlier, a quick exit to Immigration is now out of the question! Almost all other A380 operators more sensibly put the extra economy seats at the back of the upper deck. That said, Emirates service remains excellent. The Bangkok lounge offers a wide range of food and drink. On board hot towels are lightly scented and lunch menus have a choice of 3 entrees and superb wines. The bar offers premium liquors and many different canapés for those not wishing the full meal. I just have two slightly negative comments about the on-board service. With the reduced business class it would be nice if an after take-off drink is offered. Frequently one has to wait for up to 45 minutes for the meal service to start before any drinks are brought round. Secondly, despite the huge variety of entertainment offered, I still find the revised entertainment programme guide a total design mess. It is impossible to find out if movies are comedies/dramas/action etc. Worse, the guide provides no timings, so you have no idea if you have enough time to watch a full movie.

Over time, my health deteriorated a little more. When I went up to the gate staff to talk to them again, they called the medics to get me checked. The medics said I was okay to travel but at this point, the gate supervisor demanded for a doctor's note to ensure I was okay to fly. I don't understand why they needed a doctor's note when we the medics said okay. Anyway, I tried to convince the supervisor because it was incredibly important for me to get back to New York on Tuesday morning as I had some important meetings lined up. They refused. I was taken to the doctor which was one building away, and given some medicine. The doctor gave me a note in no time and I was sent back to the gate without any assistance. They took me to the hospital on the airport hospital shuttle but I was made to walk back in that condition. It took me 20 minutes to walk back to the gate to find the supervisor, who had told me I would be moved to the next flight instead once I have the doctor's note. There was no one at the gate and I was directed to the ticketing counter. After waiting the long line, they asked me to pay for my new flight, which I refused to do.

"""Don’t fly Emirates economy""",Couple Leisure,01/06/18,Australia,"  Brisbane to Birmingham via Dubai. We flew on an overnight A380 Emirates flight from Brisbane to Dubai in late September, leaving Brisbane late at night. Flying time was 14 hours 20 minutes non-stop. This was sleeping time - I thought. I paid the extra $55 to select seats in economy for my wife and myself. I boarded and sat down to our long haul flight on a seat that was already broken. The recline wouldn’t lock in, and made an awful clunking noise whenever I moved the seat back or forward. After a few hours I had worked out that if I pushed back hard and held on with my feet and my back I could get the seat to recline. But as soon as I let the pressure off it immediately sprung back – in fact it sprung back past normal upright. You can imagine the result - 14 hours plus of long haul discomfort, battling with this seat! Naturally I couldn’t keep it up for the whole flight, and so after a few hours I sat upright – or past upright. Given that the seat in front was fully reclined, while mine was leaning forward, I couldn’t even put my head on the tray table. I mentioned the problem to the Emirates staff on board, but nothing could be done as it was a full flight, they said. So I left it at that. On our return home to Brisbane a month later I wrote to Emirates about the matter. They said that they would respond within 30 days, after they had gathered the facts. On day 30 I had no answer, so I prompted them for a reply. Yes, they eventually said in their response – the seat you selected was in fact broken on that flight - we knew about it as we had a logged report on it. Sorry to hear that you didn’t find the flight comfortable. (They obviously knew about the problem on the day that they received my email - but they deliberately held out responding for the full 30 days – hoping, no doubt, that I’d forget the matter.) They went on to say:- “Given that you had availed of the Advance Seat Reservation and paid AUD55.00 for the seat, we will be pleased to refund this charge to you. Kindly provide your bank details in order to process a bank transfer to your account….thank you for taking the time and trouble to write to us. ” That was it. If I had not paid $55 to select the seat – would Emirates have just written back (after 30 days) to say, sorry about your long uncomfortable flight in our broken seat, but too bad – nothing more we will do?

"""Emirates, never again""",Solo Leisure,12/23/17,France,"  I had a flight from Bangkok to Paris (France) via Dubai. The transit was supposed to last 1h 30. With a 1-hour delay announced on the first flight (warning received by email a few hours before check-in), I thought the transit would be tight to be held. Contradictory information was given on the airport and by mail. We asked the ground staff, all they could say to us is ""no"". When finally our flight took off with a 2-hour delay, we thought we could not make it. Onboard, the crew did not want to listen to one single word from the passengers. All they could say to us is ""no"". When landing at Dubai, talking to the ground staff was of no use : all they could say to us is ""no"". So we ran to the boarding counter of the next flight. The plane was here, but we could not get inside. We waited 2 hours in Bangkok airport and the plane could not wait 15 minutes for the passengers to board, resulting in a final delay of 15 hours.

"""I can't understand why they acted like this""",Business,12/14/17,Germany," My business journey from Germany to India took me more than 38 hours, thanks to a not acceptable miss from Emirates. Starting Sunday 10th December in Frankfurt/Germany I finally arrived Tuesday morining at 5 am in Hyderabad/India. For those who don´t know - this flight usually takes not more than 14 hours. It all started with a delay due to weather-conditions in Frankfurt. Well things like this happen, but sitting for more than two hours in the plane waiting for de-icing, Emirates weren't able to serve even a glass of water to passengers. The flight itself to Dubai was ok. In order to get the connecting flight to Hyderabad/India my colleagues and me were running through the airport and finally reached the gate right on time. Everything went fine, we even managed to be at the gate more than 30 min before gate-closing - that was my thought. Here the nightmare begins: At the check-in counter the supervisor told us that our seats had been already given away without any further explanation. This is something I can't understand, I also know from another colleague sitting on the plane that the flight even had free seats (in business as well as in economy). The supervisor told us to go to the customer service counter to raise our issue and clarify how to move on. This happens around 3 am in the morning. Obviously we were not the only one, there was a long lane of passengers at the counter. We were forced to wait more than 2 hours in a line, standing on our feet without seeing any Emirates-employees offering us water, food or just some friendly words. At their home-hub in Dubai? At this point in time around 5.30 in the morning, we were already tired and exhausted. After a long explanation to the service-employee, we managed to get a hotel and an alternative flight for the next evening. In order to check-in into the hotel we need to immigrate to Dubai (another 30min of waiting at immigration) and get a hotel voucher (another 30min of waiting at another Emirates counter). Than the hotel-shuttle was overbooked as well so we pay a taxi out of our pocket to get to the hotel. Next several misses. 7 am in the morning, we got welcomed by a long lane of grounded passengers waiting at the counter to check-in. Two hours later at 9 am in the morning I finally enter my room try to get some sleep. Summary: On a long distance journey things can take a turn for the worse due to delays and this is quite normal. But: I can't understand why they acted like this. There was no apology and the inconvenience was tremendously high.

I found out about the delay only after the agent in the SAS Lounge (who doesn't work for Emirates) told me about it.  Eventually, we were told the flight was boarding.

I would fire every last one of them. They made infrequent and irregular announcements, with incorrect information. The boarding time kept getting moved. The employees sat on their phones. Finally, we started to board. Well, not the Premium passengers. First, the people traveling needing extra assistance and with children. Eventually, Business class boarded, but only after an Emirates person line jumped with a group of passengers in front of us. Once on board, I encountered a seat with a non-functional small video screen that is used to control the seat! Fortunately, the seat next to me was empty. The seat is not the standard these days. Angled lie flat is so 1980. Middle seats in Business Class? Are you kidding, Emirates? Whoever made this decision should be fired.

Furthermore, there is a box of equipment under the front seat, further reducing room for your feet, so you can't even stretch your legs as the comfort video tells you to. I know Emirates have a few configurations for the 777, it seems they put the condensed seats on the Asian routes, profiling the average body size of the passengers. Very disappointing for Emirates.

We were looking forward to flying with Emirates - we hadn't flown with them before and had heard good things. But unfortunately the customer service (or lack thereof) from the Flight Attendants onboard both flights was atrocious. I have written over a month ago to the Emirates Feedback form on their website but have not had any response - perhaps they are overwhelmed with complaints? For a start, none of the staff seemed to be smiling or happy. I didn't really think anything of it at first until I realised how uncomfortable I felt with the sour faces around me. About an hour into the flight I thought I would use the restroom. I was on the left side of the plane in an aisle seat, row 56. I had seen other passengers walking up and down the aisle using the restrooms and so I walked forward too, where I could see the toilet sign. A male flight attendant asked me where I was going? I said, ""To the toilet. I'm going to the restroom."" He shouted, ""Back! Get back. Go back!"" and flung his arm towards the back of the plane. I was shocked at his attitude and aggression that I returned to my seat. He came over to me and said, ""You can use the toilet at the back of the plane."" I explained that I had seen other people moving freely around the plane and that I felt he had spoken to me incredibly rudely. He said I could use the toilet towards the front if I wanted. I have no idea how many international and domestic flights I have been on in my 48 years, but I have never been spoken to like that - with so little provocation!  The other flight attendants were equally rude; no communication or attempt at being polite or friendly. An hour and a half before we landed in Dubai they literally pulled blankets off people and demanded headsets and were more concerned with shoving all the blankets into the toilet cubicles than with the passengers waiting to use the restrooms. Many of the passengers in Dubai were talking about how rude the flight attendants had been and why they had to take blankets and headsets from people so early? Unfortunately they were not much better from Dubai to Melbourne. Again, no smiles, no warmth - they would say ""Drink?"" with raised eyebrows (no smile) and when I would say, ""An orange juice please,"" they would place it onto a tray and just shove the tray into my face without a word. Literally into my face. I am writing because I had heard good things about Emirates - but the flight attendants have really let the company down.

"""list of negatives is quite big""",Business,11/01/17,Cambodia," The positives for Emirates is to do with the aircraft, as the A380 offers comfortable seats with adequate legroom. The list of negatives is quite big: - Crew members didn't bother to assist during embarkation resulting a really slow process. Even worse, when most passengers had to look for available cabinets to store their luggage nobody from the crew members even bothered to pretend to be interested and assist. Passengers who wanted their dinner to be accompanied with wine or beverage had to wait more than 20 minutes to be served. Long, literally long, queues at lavatories. Crew didn't assist at all. I do understand that when the not to be disturbed sticker has fallen from the seat, crew will try to wake you up in order to serve breakfast. Still that should not reach the stage where they will literally poke you and scream close to your ears. They could either open the folded tray and leave it there or let you a note that they didn't serve because you were sleeping. Having two options for dinner (when you promote yourself as top carrier) is quite limited. Saying that you have two options for dinner when the number of available portions of one is small compared to the overall number of passengers (particular flight was almost fully booked) is laughable. Some people do not eat chicken (sounds strange but I do not eat it), I can understand that due to any reasons you are out of beef (actually I do not understand it but anyway) but that does not mean that you have to force me to get your chicken dish and refuse (actually they did not refuse, just didn't bother to reply and moved on) to take it back.

I just cannot understand how an airlines that is so highly rated cannot get their service right especially in Business class. Approached the Business Class check-in person in Dubai with my wife and child and we were greeted by a grumpy lady gesturing to place our passports on the desk. No smiles, no conversation nothing, did her work, handed out our boarding passes and motioned us to the direction of the gate. Not a word was spoken. I was expecting to board directly from one of the gates at the business class lounge as generally is the case with A380 flights but we were motioned to go down to the gate and board from the gate with everyone. At the gate there was no separate boarding for business / first class, waited in the long line with everyone. Once we got into the flight, we settled down onto the amazing business class seats and was looking forward to a comfortable flight. Just then a flight attendant bumped into another attendant who was serving champagne to a customer and the whole contents of the tray spilled over on to me. I was soaked in champagne before the 14 hour journey to Toronto had even started. A quick word of apology was muttered and I was handed a towel to clean up and was directed to the washroom where some more towels were handed out while my seat was being cleaned. I returned back to my seat to find that champagne was still pouring out of the creases and cracks of my seat. I asked for one more towel and never got it. Later during the flight I asked for a headphone for my child and the response I got was ""One was placed on every seat"". That's it. I had to get one myself from another unoccupied seat. Every time the same lady came to clear my table / seat of any clutter or finished meal, I was motioned to place them on her tray. It was like she couldn't be bothered to reach out and pick them up. So I spent the flight collecting things around my seat to place it on her tray every time she came. The whole experience was really shocking especially after the fortune you had coughed up for the experience. Emirates boasts of taking extra effort to take care of children, my 3 year old's presence was not once acknowledged, the only gesture was a child's goodie bag being handed out. We also experienced similarly disappointing service at the Emirates check-in counter at Toronto airport on our way back to Dubai. No smile, no word. I asked if the flight was full to which I got the reply ""Wait I am trying to read something here"". Never ended up getting an answer.

Surely saving exit row seats for people who actually require them is a better way of operating? Other issues. Toilets were filthy, and were not cleaned during the flight.

"""we will avoid Emirates in future""",Couple Leisure,07/13/17,Thailand,"  Good bye Emirates. In January I booked flights with Emirates for my wife and me, Bangkok to Rome via Dubai, returning Munich to Bangkok via Dubai. Due to endless amendments by Emirates our trip turned out to be the worst ever. One month before departure I was informed that flight time from Bangkok to Dubai has been changed. Usually not a big deal, but I would appreciate to be asked instead of putting us on a different flight. On the flight Munich – Dubai one of the flight attendant refused to offer soft drinks except orange juice and water, referring that drinks like Fanta or Coke have to be purchased at the bar. (what bar? as we were flying economy). Waiting for flight Dubai to Bangkok at the boarding area, about 15 minutes before boarding we were informed that it was changed to a different gate and new ETD will be 13:45. Right afterwards their ground staff left without further comment. We found the new gate deserted, leaving passengers for more than 2 hours alone with questions regarding connecting fights, meals or drinks. After having breakfast on the Munich to Dubai flight at around 4am, I expected at least a snack and a drink to bridge the waiting time of 2½ hours. About 20 minutes before boarding the ground staff appeared and informed that the departure will be delayed by another 10 minutes. 10 minutes later we were informed that boarding will delayed by another 10 minutes. At this stage a considerable number of passengers lost their patience and protested loudly. Finally boarding stated at 14:05 instead of 11:45, arriving at Bangkok at 23:45 instead of 21:25. Leaving us for uninformed, hungry and thirsty stranded at Dubai airport for more than 2 hours is unacceptable and contradicting with Emirates claim to be the Best Airline in the World. Under European legislation we would be eligible to a significant refund, but unfortunately we needed to book our flights in Bangkok. With the recent reduction of economy luggage allowance from 30 to 20 kgs (unless you are willing to pay extra $ for a “saver” ticket) and the implementation of a reservation fee of 25USD per person, Emirates is getting closer to traditional low cost carriers, while asking for premium rates.

The Emirates policy of applying excess baggage charges for items purchased in duty free on the DXB to NBO sector is arbitary. I have flown Emirates on a number of occasions and have never seen a weight scale at a departure gate in DXB. Each economy passenger was directed ""as per airline policy"" to weigh all cabin bags, including those containing duty free items. The response from Emirates ground staff for extra items bought in duty free was either pay the excess or return the items for a refund from the outlet. I understand the weight limits for cabin baggage from a safety perspective. However, I have not seen any objections from an ground staff when a passenger has purchased a number of duty free items in departures. Returning on the NBO to DXB sector no similar policy applied, same for the DXB to BAH leg. Emirates need to treat all passengers as people.  Staff at the gate ignored my request to have the extra cabin bag, (bought in DXB duty free) loaded into the hold, one option used by some airlines.

Boeing 777 aircraft in 2-3-2 configuration in Business class is clearly not matching the high expectations you have if flying with this airline. The seat on this leg was old style not fully lie flat which made this morning flight quite unpleasant. Also remarkable for me that Emirates provided only on the night flight from Dubai to Shanghai an amenity kit. The content even being from a high rated known cosmetic company is not special at all lacking ear plugs. Seen much better Kits eg. Turkish Airlines or even at Tap Portugal. In general the A380 cabin and seat better but inconsistent. Seats and plugs different on all 3 flights in A380. Seat lie flat but felt unconfortable to me as uneven. Also negatively surprised by the service level provided by the crew which was from hectic to chaotic. As noticed from others fellows in this Forum seems to be a hit or miss. Though always announced from the Cockpit ""as award winning cabin crew"" I was unfortunate and got too often the miss. Only exception was the crew on the B777 leg contrasting to the aircraft.

On boarding the cabin crew were chatting among themselves in the galley areas and there was no-one to welcome us to our normal (47K) seat in the rear cabin.

After this they disappeared into the galley areas for 5 hours, occasionally rushing through the cabin but ignoring our call bell when we fancied a drink before lunch which was then served 1.5 hours before landing meaning that it was rushed - coffee and wine were being offered at the same time and they wanted to clear trays before we had even finished the main course (which to add to our dismay was tough, grisly beef).

"""they fly the A380 on all legs""",Couple Leisure,03/09/17,Netherlands,"  Starting with the best part: one of the reasons we selected Emirates is that they fly the A380 on all legs of our journey from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Dubai. The whole upper deck of Emirates A380 is Business class. The seats are configured 1-2-1. You can make a 180 degrees bed from it, there's a huge screen, a separate tablet (no idea why) and a mini bar with some drinks on it. Lots of space for everything. In the back there's a bar with lots of delicious small things to eat and a good reason to leave your chair from time to time, even if you do not normally visit bars. The A380 is super silent. We flew Business Class on a Qatar 787 earlier and the noise level of the 787 is so much higher than that of the Airbus. The A380 is the best plane we have flown, unbelievable that they have struggled for orders. Emirates has more: free limousine service up to 65 km, in comfortable cars and all well arranged. Lounges in Dubai and Bangkok offer great food and other facilities like a shower, the Schiphol lounge in contrast has just a few things to eat. But Emirates has drawbacks too. Vegetarian meals in business class are very poor. One of our meals mainly consisted of two salads of the type ""what are the cheapest ingredients we can find"". Why not serve what they serve in their lounges? The best Business Class meals so far were from KLM. No A380's but well thought about vegetarian meals. Also we phoned if they could combine vegetarian and gluten free. That could be arranged but it wasn't. They can't. On a business class ticket with a list price of multiple 1000's euros. And it really is not so difficult. Qatar could do it. Qatar also serves the meal when you want - Emirates serves the meal shortly after you enjoyed the Dubai lounge buffet. Two more drawbacks: when we complained the reply was something like ""Sorry you didn't like it but Emirates serves the best food in the airline industry"". So they can't serve nice vegetarian meals and on top of that they don't take complaints seriously. What I also disliked is that the entertainment system (which in itself is the best we have ever seen, title wise) displays news messages on all selection screens. Why would I want that? I am on holiday and don't want to read news. But it can't be switched off.",A380-800,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Amsterdam to Bangkok via Dubai,03/09/17,yes,Verified Review,8.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,A380-800
"""I love the onboard bar""",Business,03/07/17,United Kingdom,"  My recent flight from Taipei to London via Dubai was thoroughly enjoyable, both night and daylight flights. Taipei to Dubai sector was full yet the crew managed to address passengers by name and were attentive. I love the onboard bar and despite full capacity, was rather empty, with most snuggled up to sleep. It was a 4 hour connection to London at Dubai. Even though the Dubai lounge with its facilities for relaxing, sleeping or dining, I had to wait 45 minutes for a shower to be available. However, I was refreshed for my flight back to London, the service was impeccable. Even after a Venison main course and cheese board lunch, the crew were inviting me to the bar for more snacks. I have noticed that the A380s on the Taipei-Dubai, Hong Kong-Dubai and Singapore-Dubai flights are newer seating than the London-Dubai A380s. My one small beef about Emirates Business Class is the seat itself. It must be narrowest - just an inch wider than the Economy I think. I am small, but I find it still too narrow compared to other airline seats which are 20-22 inches wide. One passenger I spoke to said he could not get any sleep and felt claustrophobic. I guess seat width has been sacrificed to include the clutter of the Mini Bar and Tablet (I've never seen anyone use the Tablet). Overall Emirates for me is good value, and cheaper than flying direct to Asian destinations, and I enjoy the break in Dubai anyway.

"""missed 4 days of our trip""",Family Leisure,03/01/17,United States,"  Los Angeles to Delhi via Dubai. We have flown Emirates several times to visit family in India. However, in December 2016, an issue arose with our plane during take off. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. They kept us on the plane at the gate for 3 hours. They fed us dinner and right after we were told to exit the plane. We knew we wouldn't be taking off that night, so having us sit in the gate area would've allowed for more comfort and food options. After those 3 hours, we stood in a line for 3 hours to get a hotel voucher since the next flight we could be on was not until Friday morning (it was 1am Wed Night at this point) and did not live close to the airport. We obtained the hotel voucher and headed to our hotel, only to be returned because the hotel was full and said the airline didn't call them to approve the availability. Needless to say, we didn't get to a hotel until 5am. We were put in a hotel 12 miles away and were told we could get refunded for the Uber, but it's been 2 months since the receipt was submitted and still have not received the $58 back. Flight Friday was delayed again by about 5 hours, so we missed our connection and had to stay in Dubai a night since there were no open flights. So we missed 4 days of our trip. The cabin is nice, clean and updated. The food is usually pretty good for airplane food! There is good pitch between seats and good seat width. On our trip back though, our seat cushions were pretty poor in quality and rather uncomfortable/hard to sit on. I would fly again, but seeing how they recently changed their ""saver"" rates to where you cannot choose your seat until check-in, we are looking for another airline.

No explanation, no apology nothing such rudeness in the way they treat passengers. On boarding the aircraft witness an angry passenger who wanted my seat apparently and made a fuss to the cabin crew and chief Steward. She was a lone passenger so it appears that the ground crew lied about a couple wanting to sit together. Why should I be inconvenienced at the expense of others - am I not a passenger worthy of some dignity and respect? The service on this flight was at best sloppy and the crew seemed unpolished. Some were though to be fair so forgivable.

No matter how much I tried, I could not get comfortable in the seat. Cabin crew were friendly on boarding but during the flight they seemed very elusive. A walk to the bar area on several occasions found that passengers in the bar outnumbered by cabin crew. Meals on this leg of the journey were less than memorable and service was poor; I am still waiting for the cheeseboard to be served even though I reminded cabin crew three times that I had not received it.

"""I have to bring up two issues""",Business,02/22/17,Thailand,"  I have been taking Emirates service between Bangkok and Hong Kong a few times a year for more than 6 years. Little has changed (although on the more recent A380s there is unfortunately no side pocket for books, iPads etc.), the meals and wines remain very good, the bar at the back is excellent, service is efficient and the lounge offerings better than most airlines. Plus I love the aircraft. But I have to bring up two issues. The IFE Guide used to be user-friendly. Now the airline has jazzed it up, it is a design mess and extremely difficult to read! Movies have no timings. What is the point of that, especially for short flights? To find out timings you have to open each channel and wade through ads each time. So if you are considering which of 4 or 5 movies to select you waste a lot of time and patience with the added possibility you'll miss the end of the movie before landing. Then there are the audio programmes. Once again the classical music section used to be hugely comprehensive. Now it is another mess. What is the point of having a composer's name as the title of a channel - like just Mendelssohn or Mozart - when the works being performed are not listed? Do we have to check the screen every time? If so, then even that often does not provide the information. Wagner wrote operas and so is understandably included in the Opera section (although with no works listed). Yet he also appears in the non-operatic section. To find out what that included, I started the channel. Nothing on the screen gave me any clue what was about to be played. Never mentioned anywhere is the fact it is the opera Das Rheingold - almost two and a half hours non-stop music and singing! No indication either of artists, conductors and orchestras, all of interest to those listening. Something really has to be done to include more pertinent accurate detail in the Guide. My other disappointment was having foregone the meal and watched a movie, when it was over I went to the bar to get some canapés. As I went to the nearby toilet to wash my hands, there were plenty available. Less than 45 seconds later, everything had been dumped into the trash bins - even though there were still 35 minutes of the flight remaining and drinks were still being served.

Second, on the flight from Dubai to Hong Kong, they ran out of food (food, not food selection) when the trolly reached me.

Her solution was to give me an economy main course, and not having enough food to fulfil all requests is unacceptable. The staff seemed disorganised and some had a poor grasp of English. My wife and I asked two simple questions of the attendants, one did not know and the other did not understand and had to get a senior.

My return flight London to Melbourne was one of the worst flight related experiences I've been through and a huge disappointment. One half of the entertainment screen on the first leg of the journey (LHR to DXB) was unresponsive so I gave up on trying to watch anything. The provided headphones are awful, and you can't use you own because of the archaic two ports stereo jack they work with. The food was simply awful on 4 of the 5 flight legs on my journey. Apart from the crackers and cheese, I ate next to nothing. Airport staff are incredibly slow at doing anything. Just one example: boarding our connecting flight in Singapore, they chose to guide all the 800 or so passengers onto the plane by having a junior member of staff hold boards with the boarding zones up. If you haven't been in the Singapore airport before, you'll probably not know that a huge part of the seating area at the boarding gate is behind the counter, so if you were sitting there, you couldn't see the boards at all, while another member of staff was trying to shout what zones were being boarded when. This confused a lot of people, that simply couldn't hear or see what was being announced. The worst is yet to come, as our return flight MEL to DXB was delayed by two hours due to fog on an earlier flight, this made us miss our connecting flights in Dubai. You'd think that, with such a big airline as Emirates everything would be fine as they surely have other flights to go onto.

I hardly ever sleep on planes and find it comforting to have so much good entertainment during the long flights. We like the food. We have always had good experience with check-in, boarding and disembarkment. So when I had an accident during our last trip to Thailand and broke my ankle, I was fitted with an Aircast so that I could fly home. My insurance was taking care of everything but the one thing they refused, no matter how many times I asked or even with a written statement from my doctor, was to upgrade my husband so that he could be by my side during the long and uncomfortable journey home. I was unable to walk unaided and therefore needed personal assistance. I was upgraded to Business Class, which would have been a great experience under any other circumstances. As it was I daren't eat or drink much of what was on offer (all looked delicious) out of fear of being caught short bathroom wise.

"""overall I was disappointed""",Solo Leisure,12/27/16,Kuwait,"  I took a first class ticket Dubai to Kuwait, but overall I was disappointed with the experience. First, my chauffeur driver never informed the hotel that he was waiting for me outside as I instructed EK to do so via my telephone conversation in Dubai. I had no idea he was waiting for me outside. The first class check-in experience was not as tremendous as I anticipated. Basically there was attention given to me, but I never felt like a first class passenger. They let me check-in in the express check-in counter as opposed to the first class counter. The food and service provided in the first class lounge in concourse A is unacceptable. Not only was the food tasteless, but it takes a very long time to prepare something for me from a la carte menu. For example, it took approximately 10 - 15 minutes to provide me my club sandwich, and 15 - 20 minutes to provide me the ""um ali"" sweet. All this while the lounge was empty. While I was waiting for my food the waiter asked me what I wanted to drink and I told him water, he kept goofing around and I chased him until he gave me my water. This is unacceptable for first class service. During boarding business class passengers entered door 1A with us as opposed to door 2A, thus ruining the exclusive experience of first class. Upon disembark, business class passengers were trying to skip queue and leave the aircraft before first class passengers do.  I will not be flying Emirates first class again and will look for alternatives such as Qatar Airways.

"""sound a bit like a spoiled brat""",Couple Leisure,12/26/16,United Kingdom,  Mumbai to London via Dubai. Wasn't the greatest experience with Emirates - check in was a headache. We were 8 kilos overweight between two of us and they charged us for the excess. Boarding was fine and seats comfortable but they feel a little claustrophobic. The staff were good. My wife was charmed by her attendant but I got the feeling my attendant thought she was doing me a favour by serving me. It doesn't cost any thing and takes minimal effort to smile when talking to a customer. Meals were only served within a timeslot so you couldn't eat when you wanted to and weren't really up to expectations. The champagne wasn't served cold enough. I had to return 3 glasses and in the end I went to the bar myself to make sure. The bar itself was a bit of a disappointment but maybe we were too tired to appreciate it. The seat has an area with a selection of soft drinks which you can access yourself. Unfortunately its protective frame needed two arms to prise up and then the drinks weren't cold so I had to call for ice. The entertainment system was a bit tricky to operate and took a little while to work the IFE. The upper deck of business class probably had 100 passengers in total and felt a little overwhelming.  I felt that there were not enough attendants for the number they were taking care of. There were 4 loos between us but the loos were just a bit larger than the economy toilets and disappointing. I couldn't use one because it was too messed up. When we landed no attendant offered to help my wife with her luggage from the overhead locker but it was nice to have our own upper deck exit way. On reading through this I do sound a bit like a spoiled brat and complaining over small things. But if some airlines can get these right so why not Emirates?

Can't fathom why a lunch was served so early in the day. The bus from terminal to plane was extraordinarily long and seemed to take for ever but was most definitely at least 20-25 mins. The aircraft itself was definitely very dated and the seats far from the best. All in all it was a distinctly average experience and isn't likely to encourage us to use Emirates in the future.

The Emirates A380 is huge, quiet and with a brilliant in-flight entertainment system, only let down by the headphones. So my advice is but a two pin adaptor and wear your owns to get the full benefit. But that's where it ends. On both the outbound and return legs, the inflight service was terrible. Slow to the point of lazy, a choice of menu that's undeliverable by the time they've reached the middle of the flight, staff who offer little by the way of a solution when asked what's possible and disinterested in passenger comfort. I had to wait 40 minutes for a meal to be offered to me after I asked for a different main course to what was available in the trolley, and then it was the same meal I had declined. I asked to speak to the cabin manager twice, who finally arrived 10 mins later to apologize. On the return flight, the experience was much the same. No choice of menu for over half the passengers, two hours into flight before offered a drink and my meal arrived 50 minutes (!) after my wife's vegetarian ""choice"" was offered to her. This was labelled Vegan which isn't what was ordered and then another 10 minutes debate occurred with the cabin crew who said that there was nothing else available unless she wanted to wait until the end of service to see what was ""left"". When I was finally presented with the remaining meal choice (chicken with olive sauce) I had to ask for a drink, and the steward said the drinks trolley was on its way - it was half the length of the plane away! Somehow other passengers were given drinks with their meals, but we at the ""back"" were treated as an after thought. The passengers behind us had exactly the same experience. A note of advice for Emirates. Olives are a divisive ingredient, people either like or dislike olives so if you include a meal with olives, more people will avoid it than choose it! Leaving you short of choice! The overhead luggage cabin had crew luggage which they proceeded to access a number of times during the flight - constantly bumping my head as they reached up. On one occasion, the stewardess walked off and left it open for 10 minutes before coming back to close it. So my overriding impression of the airline is that it needs to improve quality of service on a human level. It's all very well having the latest aeroplane but if passenger experience is based on what's on tv, and food and drink service is a secondary concern, I for one won't fly with them again.

"""lack of professionalism""",Solo Leisure,11/03/16,United States," Arriving in to Delhi from Kuala Lumpur, I was in the transit zone to catch my flight the next morning with Emirates with a final destination to Lisbon. I had no checked luggage and warned Emirates prior leaving (early that morning) of my arrival in order to allow for a smooth transfer and me to check-in at the hotel in Delhi Terminal 3. I have previously done this with multiple airlines without any issues. AirAsia, a budget airline, ensured that I would be brought to the transit area and confirmed twice (additionally to my early confirmation) with Emirates staff in Delhi that I would be arriving. Upon getting to the transit zone (escorted by AirAsia staff), I was told that Emirates staff should be there and that they would assist me. It took 30 minutes for someone to show up. Needing a ticket to pass the security in the transit area, the Emirates staff had to go and print it outside; so I was told. I was expecting this to be already printed upon my arrival as everyone was warned. This not being that case, I was told that it could be arranged in 15 minutes. It took a total of 6hrs during which I was told constantly every hour that it will be another 15 minutes by Emirates staff. I couldn't sleep all night and obviously didn't get to the hotel in terminal 3. On top of this, no upgrade was available on the flight to allow me to get a bed when when I was promised by staff that I could do this at the gate counter. Some staff were completely incompetent by either constantly pointing at other individuals saying that they couldn't help me or giving wrong information.

They offered me the next available flight and free ticket but I refused as I was traveling with my colleagues and had to be in Frankfurt for a meeting.

After waiting until almost boarding time, they finally allocated me a seat and ask me to rush to the gate. Onboard, I checked in my coat and went to the allocated the seat 65C which is right next to the lavatory. Throughout the entire 6.5 hour journey, it was just horrible.

Just before landing, I press the assistance button to retrieve my coat. Nobody answered. Upon landing, I immediately walked up to a stewardess asking for my coat and she said I had to wait until all the passengers leave so that they can bring it up from the back of the plane. I mean, this returning of the coats or whatever should be done naturally before the plane lands and need not to be instructed.

I'm a frequent traveler (usually every other week on CX or MY) I only choose Emirates since the kids wanted to travel on an A380 from Bangkok to Hong Kong. We had seats 52H/J/K next to the galley, to say passengers may find the noise from the galley troublesome is a huge understatement. Firstly, the galley is brightly lit and lights shine directly on you, they don't use a curtain. Even if you block the light with a mask you have the noise, lots of noise, if it's not the constant banging of the galley cupboard doors it's the cabin crew talking. Meals were low grade and poor quality. Meal service took forever and was completely unorganized, my special meal arrived and then was promptly removed never to return. 50 minutes later I was offered a regular meal. Condensation from the galley freezers made the floor soaking wet in front of and below our seats - the crew explained this always happens and covered the area in blankets.

"""crew were mainly pleasant""",Couple Leisure,10/07/16,United Kingdom,"  Glasgow to Melbourne via Dubai with Emirates. On the GLA-DXB sector, the Boeing 777-300ER was just 11 months old, clean, tidy and with impressive IFE. We had chosen the back of the plane where the window seats are in twos and would recommend this for couples; it felt spacious and comfortable. The 3-4-3 layout of the rest of the economy cabin did look very cramped however. These seats at the back put you close to the toilets but did not find it to be an issue, however you are at the back of the queue for meals which meant I was lucky to get my choice (FA had to go and find me a chicken tandoori). The long Dubai to Melbourne sector had us in seats A and B of the 3-4-3 economy layout; this felt much more cramped and uncomfortable, and will avoid in future. The A380 was slightly older, with the older style of IFE which was not altogether functional; my partner's screen was buggy and only one headphone worked. There was not much staff could do about this except change her seat which would have meant splitting us up. The A380 had WiFi but it was so slow as to be practically unusable for anything more than sending WhatsApp messages. Food on both flights was excellent, both for me (normal diet) and my partner (vegetarian-lacto-ovo). The crew made a few soft drinks runs but could have been more frequent, particularly on the longer sector. There are complimentary beverages on Emirates but the crew seemed so busy you didn't feel welcome to order one outside the meal runs. The crew were mainly pleasant but could have been a bit more welcoming and enthusiastic, as I said above you didn't really feel overly welcome or waited upon (it's not their main job but it's nice to be looked after). Check-in staff at Glasgow were helpful, pleasant and efficient, but we were caught unawares by the strict (weighed at check-in) 7kg carry-on limit. Unfortunately our biggest issue was with some damage to my partner's case which meant that it could no longer be rolled and will need to be repaired/replaced. Emirates were initially helpful, sending me a form to fill out and asking for photos etc, but 3 weeks later we have heard nothing.

This is our first time traveling in business class on an A380-800, when we first booked our tickets we specifically requested special assistance for my husband who is in the wheelchair and unable to stand. When we arrived at the check-in counter, we asked for confirmation that special assistant would be provided at the gate to help my husband board the aircraft using an isle chair. An hour before boarding we asked the agent on duty if they had all the necessary preparation that we had asked for. In all 3 instances we were assured that everything was under control. So we relax, believing that everything was under control. However when it came time to board we were forced to wait at the aircraft door until all passenger had been boarded because no preparation had been made to assist my husband into the aircraft. At this point the flight crew apologized to us for the confusion and inconvenience. After another 20 mins waiting we accessed the business class section on the upper deck using hilift truck (typically use for catering) from which we boarded the aircraft and were moved to our seat location. Unfortunately there were no moveable armrest on any of the business class seats that would enable a wheelchair bound passenger to transfer from the isle chair to the seat without risking injury. Fortunately my husband is strong enough to transfer over the arm rest without falling down or injuring himself (perhaps they are no fully accessible first or business class seats on Emirates), everything else from that point on until we disembarked was excellent!

We waited nearly half an hour from first to main course, but it was when the main course arrived that things really went downhill. The menu promised ""Braised beef brisket served in a rich jus with mashed potatoes and turned root vegetables"". What was served up with a barely warm meal with a dried up chunk of meat minus any jus. Judge for yourself from the photo. When I drew the attention of one of the cabin crew to this, she apologised and said she would find out what had gone wrong and come back to me. 20 minutes went by with no one coming back, so I pressed the call button, which was completely ignored (this in itself is worrying as it may have been an urgent matter that needed crew attention). I finally collared the purser as he was passing, got another apology and an explanation that all the beef meals were minus the sauce and offer of the same again but heated up. When I declined, explained that my partner and I were allergic to fish ruling that alternative out and didn't like curry, the other alternative, he said he would go away and see what else he could come up with. Five minutes later and the offer was beneath contempt - the purser brought the fish and curry meals I'd already rejected and two other dried up meals from economy. He then, very reluctantly said he'd see if there was anything else available from first class and claimed that they had the same meals so there was nothing he could do. I decided to pass and go the the sweet course (15 minutes waiting for that) while my partner decided not to eat at all. For the remainder of the flight, the cabin crew did their best to ignore us, or when they had to interact, their manner was off hand to say the least. Customer focus was lacking completely.

If traveling to first world destinations, Emirates provide their latest aircraft, with state of the art features and polished services. However, take a flight to a not so developed destination and you are better off flying one of the budget airlines in the sector as there isn't much difference between the services and a whole lot to gain in the price. Flying to London heathrow on their A380 you would expect the best and unfortunately it failed to impress.  Had previously enjoyed Emirates design and layout of the A380 but having flown recently, it seems they've tried to save up on costs with reduced spacing between seats with thinner cushions.  Emirates staffs feel more likes nannies than polished butlers. Although they speak more than a dozen languages and look fashionably tailored, that's where it ends. An economy return ticket from Dubai to London was priced at a whopping 1200 GBP when other airlines were much cheaper. The only advantage I saw in paying so much was that it was a direct flight and I didn't have any lengthy layovers.  One would expect that after having checked in online a baggage drop would be quite a simple task and hardly time consuming. However, it seemed like the baggage drop lines were bigger than regular Check in queues and I don't really find much of a differences in what the staff were doing in the check in counters and baggage drop counters.

After 10 min they apologized, and offered to cook the right one but this took another 30 min. Halfway through the flight the seat completely jammed, but I could easily pick another one as the cabin was less than half full. I must say Emirates' first class seat is in fact worse than their lie flat business class seats on the A380s. Upon arrival in Dubai, I used Emirates chauffeur service, was assigned one of their cars but the driver told me he didn't know the (Meydan) hotel and asked whether I could guide him. Which I could not, so I asked for another car and driver, and left the car. But the organizers of the service on the pavement insisted I wait until they explained the route to follow to the driver. I did not want to wait at midnight with 36C temperature outside, and only after insisting really hard did they call another driver.

Birmingham to Dubai we had the A380 which was very comfortable with seats that I could sit cross-legged on. The entertaintment system was also amazing. This is where the positives end as the boarding of this flight took so long that there was an hour delay to take off. The organisation for transfers was poor to non-existent with a massive queue for security at Dubai with minimal time for the connection. For the rest of our flights, Dubai to Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka to Dubai with a stop at Male and Dubai to Birmingham, we had the smaller and older aircraft B777-300. This was noticably older, dated and uncomfortably cramped. The entertainment screens poor quality in comparison. The worst of all was the inflight service. Pressed my buzzer for help with a non-functioning screen and an hour later, nobody had come to ask what I needed. In the end, I had to keep pressing the buzzer continuously about 15 times before someone came to us. I had no entertainment for the duration of 2.5 hours. It only took 5 minutes to fix when they actually got round to it. The food and beverage service also poor. They had a choice of fish or chicken but by the time they got to aisle 23, they had completely run out of chicken. I offered to wait till the end of service to see if any was left. I was told categorically there was none left and then later I saw them handing chicken to some passengers. On the 8-hour flight from Dubai to Birmingham, after an hour on the plane before take off and an hour on the bus waiting to board the plane, apart from the little tub of water with the snack and breakfast, no drinks runs to even offer people water.

Comfort of the bed was OK, a little more padding would be nice. They provide you with a mattress and blanket, which helps. Seat 14K has direct window access with storage against the wall which was great. Boarding directly from the lounge at Malpensa was really nice, I love the inflight bar in the back.

There was a long line at check in at LHR Terminal 3. Security was smooth, though. There are a range of big brand duty-free shops at T3 so that was a bonus. Then boarding came. In my personal opinion, Emirates should have extra boarding time for bigger planes like the A380s as the long line resulted in a delay of 1 hour. After boarding, I checked out our seats. The seats are comfortable with adequate leg-room. The IFE System was clearly bigger and better than the last time we flew with Emirates. The flight was smooth as usual with EK and the meal was very delicious with now more bigger portions. We safely landed at Dubai International Airport at Terminal 3.

"""memorable for all the wrong reasons""",Couple Leisure,08/09/16,United Kingdom," 
The car arrived at our Singapore lodgings in fine time, and we were soon on our way to Changi, where we arrived in time for a very fine breakfast in the First/Business Lounge. We were welcomed aboard our 777, with the usual courtesy, but my infotainment screen wouldn't work. Attempts to re-boot failed. Fortunately there were empty seats with working screens so I moved. All went well until the pilot announced we were about to commence our descent into Dubai. I switched to the 'flight details' on the screen of my 'new' seat. Without warning the 'destination' changed from 'Dubai' to 'Sharjah'. Ten minutes later the pilot announced that we would indeed be going to 'Sharjah', and another ten minutes later we indeed landed at Sharjah. Our 777 'parked' alongside several others, in a secluded corner of the airport. Hours passed. We weren't allowed to leave the plane. Information was hard to come by from the crew, but someone with contacts in Dubai learned on his mobile phone that there had been a serious incident at Dubai which closed the airport. Without warning buses arrived, and we were asked to board them. It looked like the bus depot rejects had been mobilised. We found ourselves in a minibus which had definitely seen better days. It did have air con but I made the mistake of sitting in the front over the engine, which gave out more heat than the air con gave cool. We set out, we knew not for where, in a convoy with police escort. After many stops and starts, we eventually arrived at what appeared to be the 'employees' entrance of Dubai airport. A man in white robes and a baseball cap then appeared to assume responsibility for our 'convoy'. With much gesticulating he seemed to instruct the drivers of the buses in our convoy to follow him. He drove an ordinary saloon car, with a yellow flashing light on top through a security gate, and our convoy of barely street legal buses followed him 'airside'. Eventually, driving by parked planes, and other 'airside' traffic, we came to an 'arrival gate', we were only too pleased to leave the oven-hot interior of the mini bus for the air conditioned splendour of the main terminal building at Dubai. Imagine our delight when we saw that the 15.00 hrs departure for Glasgow had not yet left. It was now about 19.30hrs. The 'departures screen' announced 'Gate Open', so we made our way there and checked in. The Emirates staff in attendance couldn't tell us when the delayed flight might actually depart, but they did advise that we should stand by. Eventually the flight was boarded, and took off at about 21.30hrs. Six and a half hours late. The flight was incident free, although again I couldn't make the 'infotainment' system work, and we landed at Glasgow at 01.45hrs on Thursday 4th August 2016, just under six hours behind schedule. Our bags of course were still in the Middle East, so carrying practically nothing we went to get our chauffeur car home. The final indignity. They had given 'our' car to someone in greater need, we would have to make do with a complimentary local taxi. So ever so jet lagged, a taxi, nearly as grotty as the Sharjah mini bus, but not so hot, delivered us home in the wee small hours of the morning. Actually less than six hours behind schedule was so much better than I feared when we first diverted to Sharjah.

Within 10 minutes of arriving at the airport I was seated in Emirates' excellent lounge enjoying an outstanding breakfast, as good as you will experience in the best 5 star hotels: cut fresh fruits, eggs benedict, stuffed field mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, warm bread and croissants. There were a selection of freshly squeezed juices and smoothies, but I opted for a glass of Veuve Cliquot champagne. Boarding was on time and we were soon seated with a friendly welcome and another glass of champagne. The business seat on the 777 is a little narrower than on the A380, but still very comfortable and it reclines to a lie flat bed, with nice new design duvet. Service throughout the flight was perfect with very good crew visibility and a purser who really was outstanding and lead by example. We enjoyed drinks and nuts (Emirates makes a very good Mojito), then a 5 course lunch, with light bites or afternoon tea served before landing. The inflight entertainment is of course very good, although unfortunately there was no WIFI or live TV on this 777. We arrived on time and were soon disembarked.

Food was mediocre; dried out (overheated) bread rolls and over-cooked dinners for both my husband and I. Staff are super though, that's their strength for sure. Arrived DXB, long bus ride to terminal (almost 15 minutes), very long walk and another change of terminals to find the next gate. Boeing 777 was really outdated; if you are not travelling with a partner, get ready for a stranger to climb over your not-very-flat bed to reach the aisle. Not acceptable in today's business class choices. TV screens are huge but the pixels make for grainy viewing and both my husband and I experienced our screens reverting to a puff-piece on Dubai and Emirates quite a few times when we were enjoying a movie. We could not connect to onboard wifi. Emirates lounge in DXB over-crowded with totally inadequate, smelly toilet facilities and queues at all times in both the men's and ladies loos.

There was a male passenger in the seat over the aisle and I must admit I felt very exposed and too close to him. Luckily there were several empty seats so I moved to a window seat - this time seat over aisle was unoccupied. Seat was very easy to move and very comfortable. Later I was offered a mattress but didn't need it. Staff very pleasant and helpful although during the flight I did ask for a drink of hot water which I never received. Meal served on white cloth. China by Royal Doulton. It felt lovely to drink out of a porcelain mug. Food was ok - better than Economy of course. I was able to have my choice but I think I chose wrongly. Later I had afternoon tea - bread had dried out but fillings very pleasant - much better than economy's which are sometimes inedible. Nice big screen to watch. I visited the bar area which was fun.

Nice touch was the barman taking souvenir photos on request for passengers at the bar in an old style 60s technology Polaroid type camera - quite exciting for my daughter seeing a picture appear.

I did stop for a couple of years when they went really bad in almost every aspect, but lately they have picked up on service and everything. On my recent flight though there were many things not right again. The service with Emirates is hit and miss. You can get lucky with extremely polite and efficient staff or very unlucky with poor staff. On this trip I experienced both. When a flight attendant replies to guest complaint about the ice cold, ie. not heated food with the answer she could not know I wanted it hot, then there is something severely wrong. Within Asia you will have good staff, within Europe you won't. The new A380 is a pleasure to fly, it is more spacious and new. The second leg of my journey was on an older model, a Boeing 777-300 and that was awful. It is impossible to move, eat, sit or do anything. My worst concern was the disgusting food.

I'd recommend joining their rewards program if you use Emirates regularly as you start getting enough points to reach Silver/Gold membership.

"""airline leaves customers stranded""",Solo Leisure,04/14/16,United Kingdom,"  Horrible airline that leaves customers stranded and out of pocket. My original flight was to depart 4th April from Tokyo Haneda to Brussels via Dubai. I had a connecting Eurostar booked from Brussels to London, which is my final destination. Due to the unfortunate events at Brussels, my flight from Dubai to Brussels was cancelled. However, I was informed (with a lousy text) less than 24hrs before the first leg to Dubai. I then had to contact customer service and spent hours trying to get my flight rerouted. 1st, they wouldn't take me to my final destination which was London, nor did they offer me a reroute to bring me back to Brussels to catch my Eurostar to London. They said my ticket could not be refunded due to ticket class (when they cancelled the flight) so I could not book another flight to get myself home to London. They said the only way I could go to London with Emirates was to top up EUR700, which is ridiculous. They told me to ring back every 2-3 hours to check if I got on a rerouted flight as all forwarding flights from Dubai were overbooked (I was in a completely different timezone, had to wake up every few hours, and less than 20 hours before my first leg was to depart) and they also emphasised that if I arrived in Dubai and was not confirmed on a connecting flight (I'll be in the air, so I wouldn't know till I landed), I will have to cover my own accomodation in Dubai till a connecting flight could be confirmed. Extremely frustrated with the situation, I told them to book me on the first confirmed flight that I could get all the way from Tokyo to Paris, which resulted in me being stranded in Tokyo for 2 additional days. I also had to pay for a new Eurostar ticket back to London as Emirates would not cover it. Adding a cherry to the cake, my luggage did not arrive with me in Paris (which I did attempt to check at Dubai that the luggage did make it to the connecting plane, and I was assured it did). After much arguing, Emirates baggage staff assured me that they will send the luggage to my forwarding address directly in London. Fast forward to 13th April, rang Emirates in the past few days only to find that they didn't know where my luggage was other than it was put on a flight to Heathrow on 8th April. Yesterday, the French office told me to call Heathrow myself to look for it. After arguing with them, they then contacted their UK team and located my bag at the airport. Emirates French office customer service then told me to go to Heathrow T5 Belt XX to collect my delayed luggage. I was infuriated and instead of offering to arrange delivery to me as they had promised on the 6th April, she offered me an email address to contact to try and 'convince them to send it to me'. I don't believe they have adhered to their conditions of carriage in both instances with my cancelled flight and delayed baggage but the airline has not offered me any compensation nor apology and I am still waiting on getting my delayed luggage back from the most incompetent airline.

"""Emirates seem much improved""",Solo Leisure,04/13/16,Thailand,"  After traveling on long distances routes with various carriers over the last 5 years I decided to go back and revisit Emirates in the A380 transiting in Dubai. I'm happy I did. Flew Hong Kong to Madrid via Dubai. Emirates seem much improved to me. The upper deck in the A380 is peerless, but there are a number of things that set Emirates apart now, in my opinion. The ground staff and transit interactions in Dubai, at least in Business, are just head and shoulders above anything else. The Business Departures is actually separate and you enter the plane directly from the lounge: stress-free, anyone? No lines, no hassle, no hysteria. The synergy is seamless. I love Cathay and Hong Kong, but they don't have that. JFK or Heathrow? Dream on. I recently had an appalling transit experience with Turkish in Istanbul and I would say this flight on Emirates showed how much more professional and logistically advanced Emirates are than that overrated carrier. Not to mention that the Dubai lounges are huge with great food and smiling staff. On board: again, top service, attentive and unfailingly good-humored. The walnut panelling is really nice, the cabins are soothing and elegant. The inflight screens are huge and crystal clear, wide selection of multi-lingual movies, including new releases from Korea and Japan. Food was superb, and I mean superb. For the first time in years I actually enjoyed the entire experience of a 14 hour flight. Moreover, they offer free limo service in every city you arrive in: they don't botch the reservations and the guys are waiting for you at the gate. What! Given that their prices are average, I would say Emirates now outclass almost every other long distance carrier if we except the Japanese, Korean Air, Singapore and Cathay, and maybe Quantas. But do any of these offer the add ons and extras that Emirates offer? I'll have to try a few of them in the near future. However, for the time being I am switching my allegiance to Emirates because they have cracked the nut on this one.

Food and entertainment both acceptable. However, the service on both this leg and the Dubai to Bangkok leg was sadly lacking. Pressing the call button usually resulted in a 10-15 minute wait. The same couldn't be said for the return legs 2 weeks late where the crew couldn't have been more attentive. Couple of points of note: The A380 is a wonderful aircraft. Spacious, bright, quiet and comfortable. If you are sat towards the front downstairs there is a slight lack of overhead locker space due to the way the aircraft tapers in. It is much quieter sitting at the front compared to elsewhere in the aircraft so do try and sit in the forward cabin. Boarding was hit and miss at both DXB and BKK. Some announcements were done via the tannoy and some by the ground crew shouting out instructions. From DXB to BKK, there was a drunken passenger who kept singing and waking passengers up.

It's not a normal thing for me to travel in business class, but it isn't a distant dream anymore. The seats appealed to me, and I loved the layout. Once I had settled in, I spotted one flaw, which was the lack of storage everywhere, but the storage available just about accommodated all my items. Once we had taken off, I sat down to what I would have described as a 'bumpy flight' coming from a nervous flyer though. However, the wide selection of movies, space available for sleep and excellent dining occupied my thoughts to more important things. There are only a couple of words to describe this cabin - beautiful, elegant and stylish. The second flight had a more tranquil atmosphere in a smaller cabin with a different design, due to an older, smaller plane. The entertainment was a little disappointing, as the response for all the channels (which were very limited) was far from instant.

"""crew were not so attentive""",Solo Leisure,04/06/16,United States,"  I chose Emirates for 3 reasons, ability to fly out of Boston, pricing, and desire to experience the A380 for the first time. I had flown EK once previously, a HKG-BKK one way several years ago. I was aware of their 4 star ranking and recalled from my previous trip that I felt that accurate. I am not sure that I would give them a solid 4 ranking based on these two flights. First, the good. Despite a miserable snowstorm in Boston we only had a brief delay in departure and made up time enroute. The flight only had 130 passengers so boarding was quick and easy. I would have thought that the high ratio of FAs to pax would have resulted in exemplary service. Not so. There was no drink service offered and an hour after takeoff, needing to take some medicine, I was finally able to flag down the Purser who promptly took care of me and checked back several times throughout the flight. Pity the rest of the crew were not so attentive. One appeared annoyed when I asked for another drink and pressing the call button was ignored. Though the bell sounded and the light went on, the FA told me it wasn't working when I walked back to the galley. The food at lunch suffered from the long delay in serving it. The chicken pesto sounded great but was too difficult to cut let alone chew. The bread (in cellophane) was cold. The flight itself was very smooth. Changing to the A380 in Dubai was trying due to the extreme heat and the mass of people. Once aboard I found that the seat I had selected from a seating chart was not where I expected it to be. Aisle seat next to the middle galley. I was banged into by FAs the entire flight, rarely with an apology. The service trolleys were continually blocking every aisle in every direction making a trip to the pitifully scare restrooms an ordeal. The food was better than the trip out. So good, in fact, that the FAs were continually eating. I have never seen so many FAs consuming food in plain view of pax. Again, smooth flights but service wise I would be hard pressed to give this a sold 4 star rating. No comparison to the level of service on Qatar, which thankfully had just begun service out of Boston.

London Heathrow to Dubai started off well as I only had hand luggage so getting to gate was a breeze thanks to Emirates easy and intuitive mobile check-in. It all went downhill from here though. On boarding was clear my ICE seat back screen was not working or responding. Worse it wouldn't switch off and kept flickering. I informed a member of the cabin crew about the issue but there wasn't a lot of enthusiasm or effort made to help. I asked if could be switched off if it could not be made to work, and never heard anything for the rest of the flight leaving me with flickering screen to contend with for 8 hours which was distracting and didn't really help me sleep on a night flight. I understand things go wrong and am reasonable but its how you handle things that matters. Once over Dubai, landing was delayed and we were put in holding pattern for 1.5 hours due to fog. We were informed that ground staff would be on hand to help those with missed connections and those that had tight ones to make and I was relieved at first to see a lot of staff about. However it seemed they were only helping certain people and when I asked, I got yelled at very disrespecftfully to go look at the departure board. I was left to fend for myself when I only had 20 minutes to get my gate for the flight to Dhaka which was showing as ""Final Call"". Infuriated and out of breath I arrived at the gate just in time to be met with a surly and unapologetic gate staff. I was then shoved on bus in the Dubai heat and we were left there for half an hour without any updates past take-off time. We were then bussed to the cargo terminal where our plane was parked and boarded and then left for a further 45 minutes without much information. The saving grace of the DXB-DAC sector was the crew were quite friendly and warm, and unusually the catering was rather nice. Returning DAC-DXB, even getting into the aiport was a nightmare due the corruption and difficulties that have returned with using Dhaka airport and the use of the local airlines Biman handling team is slow and innefficient. The hassling for money of my elderly mother from her requested assistance was also unwelcome. The flight itself DAC-DXB was uneventful, but the food was atrocious even by Emirates standards - almost inedible. Thas was repeated on the DXB-NCL sector as well. All in all very much going downhill, even the hard product is showing some weariness and there's complacency in improvements on these - the 10 abreast seating on Boeing 777's is horrific. Staff attitude has always been their weak point but it has got particularly bad to the point of contempt, especially when things go wrong.

It took about 40 minutes for someone from Emirates to show up, in flight attendant gear, that knew what was going on (destination immigration system down, requiring manual checking of passports, etc). Some supervisors walked around looking harried, and useless. Anyway, having done online check-in again saved some time. Overall check-in would have taken more than an hour. At check-in desk I was made to take my cameras out of carry on and put camera bag in hold (12 kgs, my partner had less so we would have been within the allowance of twice 7 kgs but got ""it is for your safety"" lines, full flight etc), never had to do that. Anyway my lenses survived the trip. What was worse is that rules seemed totally inconsistent in terms of application.  Hold luggage we had no more than 2/3 of our 32 kgs each allowance. Onboard service in line with Emirates reputation, in terms of quality of seating (Boeing 777-300 with ten across) food, friendly attendants, 13 languages across them).

"""run through airport to catch next flight""",Business,03/22/16,Germany,"My Emirates route was Hamburg to Bangkok via Dubai, connecting to Yangon with Bangkok Airways. Hamburg to Dubai was delayed so I needed to rush to the other Gate which was unfortunately in another Terminal. From the stopover time of about 1.5 hrs I had left before boarding 20 mins. The rest of the time was the Bus from a parking position to the Gate, which took 25 mins. The flight from DBX to BKK was delayed as well, so again from around 1.5 hrs stop over was only 40 mins left until departure. There again I needed to run from the arrival gate to the departure gate, passing security once again, I made to be at the depature gate about 5 min before depature, luckily Bangkok Airways was waiting so I could take the flight. Arriving in Yangon, my luggage was lost in Bangkok due to the short stopover time. To get the paperwork done at the airport was a kind of journey, but it arrived in my hotel in the evening. The service on board is okay, nothing special. Mostly the staff was friendly and if you ask for drinks they will bring it to you. However it takes forever until they clean up the trays from the seat, which was not acceptable. Normally the stopover times were more then sufficient, however all of them ended up to be in a rush or to run through the airport to catch the next flight.

The planes are older, tired, have narrower seats and I was uncomfortable the whole journey. Try and avoid any Emirates segments that use this older equipment, it generally sours your experience of Emirates. The main problems I had with this journey was the late departure. The 4 hour delay caused me to miss my booked connection, and I was put onto the dog-leg segment via Malaysia.

"""such a nightmare""",Family Leisure,03/12/16,Australia,"I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare.  The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome.  Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was there with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves.  Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes. I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again, different attendant but same story! I was forced to sit upright all the way.

It was a bit of a mixed bag: I did my back in badly the day before the long flights. Walking/sitting was a real struggle. When we arrived at Heathrow we got a wheelchair and asked about an upgrade. I was not looking for it to be free but hoped a concession could be made. There was no movement however we were given a front seat in economy so I could move around as freely as possible. My discomfort was not a negative against the economy seats as ordinarily there would have been no issue. The A380 flight out I couldn't really settle in to. The food was excellent and immediate service good. The lead attendant saw the pain I was in and said if there was anything he could do just ask. I appreciate their ability to do anything to help me was extremely limited however because of my discomfort I couldn't enjoy the in-flight entertainment but again, not their fault. Transfers etc in Dubai went well. They appeared a bit chaotic but it seemed to be controlled chaos. Because of my condition we were shepherded to a holding area where I could be taken to the right gate at the right time. The 777 flight to Male I slept through as took a strong sedative to knock me out, however I did wake for breakfast which was again very good. By the time we flew back my back was feeling a bit better so I could appreciate the in-flight entertainment more and it really is excellent. A huge choice of music, films, tv shows to eat away the hours whilst flying. The A380 we had from Dubai to Heathrow was newer than on the way out and the tv screen in economy was about the size of an ordinary laptop screen, which I thought was excellent. It was touch-screen and again the food was excellent. My only negatives (discounting my bad back which obviously wasn't Emirates fault) were that I enquired about an upgrade to business class from Dubai to Heathrow. Quoted $5000 for 2 people, which I thought was ridiculous however we wanted to finish off the holiday in style so offered $4000. Didn't move. Would they rather not sell the seats and make the extra cash anyway? She told me that Dubai had the highest upgrade charge of any airport in the word. The flight back from Dubai to London, whilst more comfortable with excellent food and in-flight entertainment, we really felt like we were economy. You get what you pay for I suppose but having your (and your girlfriends) flight-attendant call button on for 20+ mins with no response and no-one going past is unacceptable. I only wanted a drink. In the end I gave up and waited for food to be served but in typical British fashion, didn't say anything. They bragged about having in-flight Wifi.

The superior level of the seat is significant and avod is excellent. The cabin crew on this flight were friendly and attentive. The only very minor niggle is that the food and wine service were not coordinated at all, so the wine was served after the meal rather than with it. This was after two glasses of champagne and a gin and tonic though so no real complaint. The big let down was Gatwick airport where we were not offered premium service for immigration.

"""could not be bothered""",Family Leisure,02/29/16,Ghana,"Booked to fly from New Delhi to Accra via Dubai in business class with Emirates in Aug 2015 with a layover of 1 hr 20 mins in Dubai. The flight from Delhi took off 30 mins late and then circled Dubai before landing in a remote corner of the airport. We rushed and reached our boarding gate (20 mins before departure) just as the last of the economy passengers were boarding. We were denied boarding on the pretext that we were late at the gate - never mind that there was no one to receive us at the terminal, Emirates flight from Delhi was late and that last few passengers were still boarding right in front of us. Staff at the gate were rude, turned us away and asked us to get our re-routing from the Emirates customer service. With 2 kids who were sleepy and exhausted, we made our way to a long queue at the customer service counter. They routed us to Accra via Abuja and on my husbands persistent query assured us that Abuja had transit facilities. The situation in Abuja was far from this - no transit, we were made to collect our bags by paying for passenger trolleys, re-check in at Arik Air and fight customs / immigration who insisted on stamping our passports. The Arik Air flight was delayed, there was no business class lounge at the airport and the flight itself was a small propeller aircraft. We were happy to reach Accra in one piece after the harrowing experience. On registering a complaint with Emirates we were advised that they would investigate and needed 30 days - at the end of this period they came back with no admittance of guilt but offered us 15,000 frequent flyer points each which to date they have not credited to my children's account. Contrast this with our recent experience on Eithopian where we were transported from the tarmac when they were late on a flight from ACC to NBO and even connected our bags.

"""such a nightmare""",Family Leisure,02/15/16,Australia,"In December last year I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare. Let me apologise to our fellow passengers if they suffered on our account. The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome. As the attendant near me gave the safety demonstration, one of our babies whimpered a little. She rolled her eyes and groaned at the prospect of the voyage ahead. Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was their with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves. The seventy-two year old granny must have looked a fright as I walked in circles trying to lull the baby off to sleep! Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes, much to the distress of my little autistic grandson! I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again - different attendant - same story! I was forced to sit bolt upright all the way. Having outlaid almost $10,000 for Business Class, I was not happy! I would probably have been more comfortable in Economy! I would have thought that an Airline that advertises a high quality experience should be able to do better. They would have known our party was coming on board. One would have thought that for the sake of the other passengers the staff might have offered to help. Emirates always boast about how many different countries the attendants come from.

This is ridiculous given the fact that they have a large number of flight attendants in Business Class.

"""continue to avoid Emirates""",Business,01/31/16,United Kingdom,"Bangkok to Sydney with Emirates. The check in was good. Lounge was okay if very full, and the absence of flight boards was inexplicable in an airline-dedicated lounge. The food and drink adequate/above average for a small lounge. Boarding was prompt but only because I ignored the staff in the lounge and headed to the gate before the flight was called. I was amongst the first into the cabin but the rest of the Business passengers in the long missed priority boarding, which would have been inconvenient as within a few minutes the economy passengers were queuing through Business. Onboard the Business cabin felt cramped. The 2-3-2 configuration left little room for manoeuvre. There is no sense of privacy and aisle access is poor for many. The overhead locker over my seat was full of spare towels so I had to use another. Virtually no storage space around the seat other than a hole for shoes that was too small to take both of my (average sized) shoes and a front pocket on the back of the seat in front. IFE selection was adequate. Screen was large but situated in the back of the seat in front so the touch screen capability was redundant as it was well out of reach. Oddly there is no feature which stops it being seen from any angle, so in a D seat such as mine I could easily see 7 or 8 other screens. Not great if you have young children as they will perhaps see things you would prefer them not to. Also not great if the person beside you is watching the same movie as you - but has started it earlier. Complicated mini touch screen and separate controller system were not intuitive. I found the seat uncomfortable. Poorly situated armrests were at different levels and the internal one was too small. Very limited position options. The seat does not go fully flat nor to 180 degrees and when lying down I could not stretch out fully - and I am 175cm/5ft 9 inches tall. For me the key issue is the seat and so on this aspect alone I would not normally fly Emirates. The power port is recessed so that it cannot take an iPad or MacBook charger as there is insufficient room. Service was slow, an hour and 15 minutes after takeoff no drinks had been served, this on an overnight flight of 9 hours scheduled duration. Food arrived almost 2 hours after takeoff. It was OK but no more than that. The table is a good size and presentation was good. Service generally was not great. I asked for a second drink and it did not arrive after 10 minutes. Similarly I asked for earplugs from a different attendant which again did not arrive. The complimentary Bulgari washbag is large but contains unnecessary items such as large aftershave bottles - but no earplugs! There were only two toilets for 42 passengers. Definitely insufficient, it only took one person to be 5 mins plus for a long queue to build. The flight attendant apologized and told me that it was always like that. Flight arrived on time. Summary. The product feels like it is at least 10 years out of date. The main issue is the seat and configuration. Well below a Cathay, Qantas, Singapore, JAL or even BA.

I am very impressed with the experience on each flight I took. There were no major delays to speak of, the food was actually very good (minus the strange fishy starters), drinks were plentiful and they had a great database of entertainment. The tail mounted cameras are a fantastic feature and the wifi worked well - but only on 2 of the flights. The crew couldn't do enough to help, they were friendly and helpful it was refreshing compared to some airlines I have been on. One downside I found on all flights was that it took over an hour for the FAs to get the drinks trollies and begin service. Each time they started serving from the front of the cabin, which for me was fine as I was at the front - while the people in the back looked on longingly. The check-in staff at Gatwick were really miserable. Other than that, everything was perfect. The first of four legs was on the Boeing 777-300ER with 10 abreast seating. Yes the aisles are a little narrow but as there was nobody next to me it wasn't a problem. I'm 5'11 and 70kg - sat in the aisle seat and wasn't hit very often. Maybe a larger person may feel more uncomfortable, especially if the middle seat were occupied. The other 3 legs on the A380 were better. The seats were roomy and spacious, and on the DXB - KUL route the plane was 10 days old. The flight was empty and there were only about 12 people in a cabin of 120(ish) seats so the crew and I spent half the flight talking as there was little for them to do. 68A was a great seat as it has nobody in front.

Seat was a not terribly crowded aisle seat in row 41 made all the more comfortable by the fact that the person in front of me did not recline. Thank you! Inflight entertainment offerings were somewhat limited (just 400 channels) but far superior to SAA's offerings. Flight was very full in economy. Dubai to Seattle leg is a long ride: 13 hours over Iran, Russia and the north pole. Cabin service again was very good. The meal was ok; a promising chicken dish in a mustard sauce that lacked flavor when delivered but the rest of the meal was quite good. Cabin crew offered pizza a couple of hours before landing.  I was seated in a window seat on this leg which felt more crowded because I had people next to me and the guy seated in front of me reclined to the max as soon as he could and stayed that way the entire flight! IFE on this leg (ICE) was outstanding, over 1000 different selections including several Mozart channels plus a whole season of The Big Bang Theory! Plane was very full in economy.

The food on Emirates lacks a certain something. Not sure what it is but the menu just doesn't seem inspiring. Beverages on the other hand are plentiful, varied and excellent. My seat on the A380 was comfortable but I feel boxed in on those seats. The one on the 777 was a pain in the butt. I wanted to do some work on the plane but my lights shone into the face of the person seated beside me on the 777. My personal reading light did not work at all. Further to this, the lounge in Dubai is not a pleasant relaxing environment. There are just too many people running around. Not great at 3am when all you want is a good rest. I ended up going down to my gate where everyone was a lot less manic and chilled out on the comfortable long loungers. The chauffeur service was excellent, my driver going above and beyond the call of duty to deliver a great service in Glasgow. My return flight was the contentious one. I'd chosen my seat when booking, an aisle seat because I'm very tall - when I went online to check in, I find my seat has been re-allocated without even being informed. Not an obligation on their part of course but it would be nice to know. Ended up upgrading to business rather than deal with middle seat in economy. In a rare act for one so afraid of flying as myself, I managed to focus on the entertainment for more than ten minutes without losing myself to panic.
